Historically very little is known about Spartacus. We know that he came from Thrace, a land north of Greece, that he once fought in the Roman legions and that, during two fateful years, he led a slave army which nearly brought Rome to its knees. In Ben Kane's brilliant novel, we meet Spartacus as he returns to Thrace, ready to settle down after a decade away. But a new king has usurped the throne. Treacherous and violent, he immediately seizes Spartacus and sells him to a Roman slave trader looking for new gladiators. The odyssey has begun which will see Spartacus become one of the greatest legends of history, the hero of revolutionaries from Karl Marx to Che Guevara, immortalised on screen, and now brought to life in Ben Kane's great bestseller - a novel which takes the story to its halfway point and is continued in Spartacus: Rebellion.

The two motifs that run through the chapters – mourning and resilience – are theoretical frameworks that have so far not been brought into conversation in this way. The combination of trauma studies and autobiographical analysis sharpens the focus of the discussions on Indian Ocean life writing, privileging an Indian Ocean imaginary that is transnational and cross-oceanic in its orientation and pointing to networks of connections that transcend the nation state, which is often the origin of trauma in the first place. Filling a gap in Indian Ocean studies in its close readings of trauma and resilience, the book also broadens perspectives on postcolonial life writing since little attention has been paid so far to Indian Ocean autobiographical literary products. By the same token, the volume also enriches the field of Indian Ocean literary studies by incorporating life writing as an aesthetic strategy which helps to configure Indian Ocean subjectivities.",,migritude | shailja patel,

Brendon Nicholls argues that mechanisms of gender subordination are strategically crucial to Ngugi's ideological project from his first novel to his most recent one. Nicholls describes the historical pressures that lead Ngugi to represent women as he does, and shows that the novels themselves are symptomatic of the cultural conditions that they address. Reading Ngugi's fiction in terms of its Gikuyu allusions and references, a gendered narrative of history emerges that creates transgressive spaces for women. Nicholls bases his discussion on moments during the Mau Mau rebellion when women's contributions to the anticolonial struggle could not be reduced to a patriarchal narrative of Kenyan history, and this interpretive maneuver permits a reading of Ngugi's fiction that accommodates female political and sexual agency. Nicholls contributes to postcolonial theory by proposing a methodology for reading cultural difference. This methodology critiques cultural practices like clitoridectomy in an ethical manner that seeks to avoid both cultural imperialism and cultural relativisim. His strategy of 'performative reading,' that is, making the conditions of one text (such as folklore, history, or translation) active in another (for example, fiction, literary narrative, or nationalism), makes possible an ethical reading of gender and of the conditions of reading in translation.",,wizard of the crow | ngugi wa thiong o,

Written and oral verbal art are often regarded as dichotomies, one excluding the other. While orature is confused with 'tradition', literature is ascribed to modernity. Furthermore, local languages are ignored and literature is equated with writing in foreign languages. The contributions in this volume take issue with such preconceptions and explore the multiple ways in which literary and oral forms interrelate and subvert each other, giving birth to new forms of artistic expression. They emphasize the local agency of the African poet and writer, which resists the global commodification of literature through the international bestseller lists of the cultural industry. The first section traces the movement from oral to written texts, which in many cases coincides with a switch from African to European languages. But as the essays in the section on ""New Literary Languages"" make clear, in other cases a true philological work is accomplished in the African language to create a new written and literary medium. Through the mixing of languages in the cities, such as the Sheng spoken in Kenya or the bilinguality of a writer such as Cheik Aliou Ndao (Senegal), new idioms for literary expressions evolve. The use of new media, technology or music stimulate the emergence of new genres, such as Taarab in East Africa, radio poetry in Yoruba and Hausa, or Rap in the Senegal, as is shown in the section on ""Forms of New Orality."" It is a great achievement of this second volume of Versions and Subversions in African Literatures that it assembles contributions by scholars from the anglophone and the francophone world and that it covers literary production in a broad spectrum of languages: English, French, Hausa, Sheng, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Wolof and Yoruba.

Filled with case studies from within Africa and success stories from developing nations around the world, The New Harvest outlines the policies and institutional changes necessary to promote agricultural innovation across the African continent. Incorporating research from academia, government, civil society, and private industry, the book suggests multiple ways that individual African countries can work together at the regional level to develop local knowledge and resources, harness technological innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, increase agricultural output, create markets, and improve infrastructure.",,the new harvest: agricultural innovation in africa | calestous juma,

Once weaponised, it allows for the social, political and economic elevation of those who are centred within its magic circle, and the degradation, marginalisation and immiseration of those excluded as the different and inferior Other, the less than human. Speaking from Africa, a key site where the category of the human has been used throughout European modernity to control, exclude and deny equality of being, the contributors use decoloniality as a potent theoretical and philosophical tool, gesturing towards a liberated, pluriversal world where human difference will be recognised as a gift, not used to police the boundaries of the human.

Still, as though in ridicule of such notions of Africa as being the continent on the lee side of the Digital Divide, Kwani? 4 reaches into the burgeoning realms of the Kenyan blogosphere to bring such politically aware, borderline intellectual and only-two-degrees-shy-of-rebellious voices bringing a fresh look at the old themes of politics, slices of life and religion and placing them alongside such taboo subjects as sex beyond the hetero-normative ideal.

By looking at how writers of African descent have presented the practice in their literary work, Elisabeth Bekers shows how the debate on female genital excision evolved over the last four decades of the twentieth century, in response to changing attitudes about ethnicity, nationalism, colonialism, feminism, and human rights. Rising Anthills (the title refers to a Dogon myth) analyzes works in English, French, and Arabic by African and African American writers, both women and men, from different parts of the African continent and the diaspora. Attending closely to the nuances of language and the complexities of the issue, Bekers explores lesser-known writers side by side with such recognizable names as Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Flora Nwapa, Nawal El Saadawi, Ahmadou Kourouma, Calixthe Beyala, Alice Walker, and Gloria Naylor. Following their literary discussions of female genital excision, she discerns a gradual evolution—from the 1960s, when writers mindful of its communal significance carefully “wrote around” the physical operation, through the 1970s and 1980s, when they began to speak out against the practice and their societies’ gender politics, to the late 1990s, when they situated their denunciations of female genital excision in a much broader, international context of women’s oppression and the struggle for women’s rights.",,the scar : a tragedy in one act | rebeka njau,

Instead, these traditions stretch far into such neighboring countries as Somalia and Ethiopia. Simon Gikandi and Evan Mwangi assemble a truly inclusive list of major writers and trends. They begin with a chronology of key historical events and an overview of the emergence and transformation of literary culture in the region. Then they provide an alphabetical list of major writers and brief descriptions of their concerns and achievements. Some of the writers discussed include the Kenyan novelists Grace Ogot and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Ugandan poet and essayist Taban Lo Liyong, Ethiopian playwright and poet Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, Tanzanian novelist and diplomat Peter Palangyo, Ethiopian novelist Berhane Mariam Sahle-Sellassie, and the novelist M. G. Vassanji, who portrays the Indian diaspora in Africa, Europe, and North America. Separate entries within this list describe thematic concerns, such as colonialism, decolonization, the black aesthetic, and the language question; the growth of genres like autobiography and popular literature; important movements like cultural nationalism and feminism; and the impact of major forces such as AIDS/HIV, Christian missions, and urbanization.

A highly controversial character, Kimathi’s life has been subject to intense propaganda by both the British government, who saw him as a vicious terrorist, and Kenyan nationalists, who viewed him as a man of great courage and commitment. Writing in the 1970s, the playwrights’ response to colonialist writings about the Mau Mau movement in The Trial of Dedan Kimathi is to sing the praises of the deeds of this hero of the resistance who refused to surrender to British imperialism. It is not a reproduction of the farcical “trial” at Nyeri.

A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making, A Promised Land arises from Barack Obama who inspired the world to believe in the power of democracy once again. Barack Obama relates the story of his unlikely journey starting as a young boy in Indonesia and Hawaii. His time in prep school showed more passion for his jump-shot and partying than studying. We experience his college years under the admitted influence of Marxism, and into Harvard Law and as the President of the Law Review-- which would launch his political career with a substantial write-up in The New York Times. In the controversial, highly anticipated first volume, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity at Occidental College to leader of the free world. Major events bubble up in sequence to demand his analysis and thoughts. Obama offers an exploration of the awesome reach of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We examine his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the alleged death of Osama bin Laden.",,a promised land | barack obama,

This is what Henry Rono is known for. However, it is not who Henry Rono is. Henry Rono was born a poor Nandi in Kenya's Rift Valley. After an accident when he was two, doctors believed he would never again walk. This would be the first of countless obstacles Rono would have to overcome in order to pursue his two life goals: to first become the greatest runner in the world and then to become the best teacher he could be. Rono's first goal was accomplished in 1978, when he was considered not only the greatest track-and-field athlete in the world, but also by many to be the world's greatest athlete period. His second and greater goal, to become a teacher, was more difficult in coming. Once Rono became a star, coaches, agents, meet directors, and corrupt Kenyan athletic officials (whose boycotts of the 1976 and 1980 Olympics turned Rono's dreams of Olympic gold into Olympic smoke rings), wanted him to serve as their personal moneymaker, and so they did everything they could to discourage Rono's pursuit of an education and dream of teaching. The corruption and discouragement Rono encountered, as well as his alienation and exile from his homeland and family, pushed him to 20 years of alcoholism and even occasional homelessness. This is the life story of Henry Rono, whose descent from triumph to abyss, and whose subsequent ascent from abyss to triumph, are perhaps steeper than those of any track-and field athlete in history.",,olympic dream | henry rono,

Building off a sermon by his former pastor who used the same phrase, The Audacity of Hope laid out the ideas that would become the foundations of his 2008 presidential campaign. The book has 3 main points it tries to get across; that despite political differences all Americans share a core belief in community and in freedom, that a lot of our problems are due to politicians becoming more beholden to their donors than to their constituents, and that wars like the one on terrorism can’t be won using violence, since ultimately they’re wars of ideas.

The Strange Bride,Grace Emily Akinyi Ogot,"East African Educational Publishers, Kenya",,,English,,OL5350875W,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MnSiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,wikidata,"Kenya’s nationalism during the colonial period was marked by two main characteristics that feature in this book. First, the struggle for independence that was mainly characterized by the claim for land that had been taken away by the colonizers. Second was the struggle for autonomy and self-determination, mainly through political resistance. The authors in this book analyse historical trajectories of Kenya's nationalism trends while highlighting the role of political leaders, large as well as small ethnic groups, perennial conflicts, community as well as religious leaders, among others. The discussions demonstrate that quest for a national identity that is inclusive at all levels – whether politically, economically, religiously and ethnically – has marked Kenya's struggle for nationalism, sometimes leading to violence, especially during election periods, national unity through political coalitions and reconciliation, as well as institutional reforms. In conclusion, the authors demonstrate that while Kenya is gradually advancing towards national cohesion, there are still many challenges yet to be surmounted.",,the strange bride | grace emily akinyi ogot,

But to the contrary, Slavery and the Culture of Taste demonstrates that these two areas of modernity were surprisingly entwined. Ranging across Britain, the antebellum South, and the West Indies, and examining vast archives, including portraits, period paintings, personal narratives, and diaries, Simon Gikandi illustrates how the violence and ugliness of enslavement actually shaped theories of taste, notions of beauty, and practices of high culture, and how slavery's impurity informed and haunted the rarified customs of the time. Gikandi focuses on the ways that the enslavement of Africans and the profits derived from this exploitation enabled the moment of taste in European--mainly British--life, leading to a transformation of bourgeois ideas regarding freedom and selfhood. He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure. Through a close look at the eighteenth century's many remarkable documents and artworks, Slavery and the Culture of Taste sets forth the tensions and contradictions entangling a brutal practice and the distinctions of civility.",,slavery and the culture of taste | simon gikandi,

En Matumbo, Javier Triana reúne algunas de las mejores historias y de los personajes más magnéticos con los que se cruzó durante su estancia como corresponsal en Nairobi, capital de Kenia. En el libro desfilan un eterno candidato al Nobel, grafiteros pacifistas, masái en todoterreno, mujeres que cambian el mundo con sus pies, colonos chiflados, guerrilleros ancianos, pescadores sin peces y políticos de dudosa honorabilidad. Sus historias, que saltan con agilidad de lo descacharrante a lo indignante, definen un país que, como tantos otros, lucha por encontrar su sitio entre la tradición y la modernidad, entre la igualdad y la impunidad. Otro de los grandes logros de este libro, además, es la sensibilidad con la que Javier Triana entrega la voz cantante a sus protagonistas, dejando que sean ellos, los máximos conocedores de su país, quienes nos lleven de la mano en esta aventura por una realidad tan compleja como apasionante. Descubra cómo la tradición y la modernidad chocan en Kenia y sumérjase en esta apasionante cultura.

In 1977 he was imprisoned after his most controversial work, Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want), produced in Nairobi, sharply criticized the injustices of Kenyan society and unequivocally championed the causes of ordinary citizens. Following his release, Ngugi decided to write only in his native Gikuyu, communicating with Kenyans in one of the many languages of their daily lives, and today he is known as one of the most outspoken intellectuals working in postcolonial theory and the global postcolonial movement. In this volume, Ngugi wa ThiongÕo summarizes and develops a cross-section of the issues he has grappled with in his work, which deploys a strategy of imagery, language, folklore, and character to ""decolonize the mind."" Ngugi confronts the politics of language in African writing; the problem of linguistic imperialism and literature's ability to resist it; the difficult balance between orality, or ""orature,"" and writing, or ""literature""; the tension between national and world literature; and the role of the literary curriculum in both reaffirming and undermining the dominance of the Western canon. Throughout, he engages a range of philosophers and theorists writing on power and postcolonial creativity, including Hegel, Marx, Lvi-Strauss, and Aim Csaire. Yet his explorations remain grounded in his own experiences with literature (and orature) and reworks the difficult dialectics of theory into richly evocative prose.",978-0-231-15951-7,globalectics: theory and the politics of knowing (the wellek library lectures) | ngugi wa thiong o,

When a beautiful blonde girl is found murdered on thh porch of an African university professor in a small town in Wisconsin, USA, hard-working detective Ishmael Fofona knows immediately that it will be the news event of the year. What he cannot know however is that the discovery of the dead girl will change his life forever and that barely seventy-two hours after being called to the scene he will find himself on African soil, hunting for clues in a case that seemingly makes no sense. Why would Joshua Hakizimana - hero of the Rwandan genocide, a man who had saved hundreds of people from the machetes of genocidaires - kill a random white girl and then dump her body outside his house?

The East African public transport vehicle from which Matatu takes its name is both a component and a symbol of these modernities: based on ""Western"" (these days usually Japanese) technology, it is a vigorously African institution; it is usually regarded with some anxiety by those travelling in it, but is often enough the only means of transport available; it creates temporary communicative communities and provides a transient site for the exchange of news, storytelling, and political debate. Matatu is firmly committed to supporting democratic change in Africa, to providing a forum for interchanges between African and European critical debates, to overcoming notions of absolute cultural, ethnic, or religious alterity, and to promoting transnational discussion on the future of African societies in a wider world.

All four centenarians lived rich and diverse lives across several continents. In the years following the Second World War they produced more than half a century of foundational creative writing and literary criticism, and made stellar contributions to institutions and repertoires of African and black arts and letters in South Africa and internationally. The range of the centenarians' imaginations, critical analyses and social interventions spanned disciplinary divides. This volume, in the same spirit, draws on approaches that are equally transdisciplinary. Two aims thread through the contributors' reflections on the complexities of black existence and of intellectual and cultural life in the twentieth century. The first is the exploration of some of the centenarians' key texts and cultural projects that shaped their legacies. In doing so, the volume contributors trace a number of divergent intellectual and aesthetic lineages in their works and organisational activities. The second aim is a consideration of the ways in which these foundational writers' legacies continue to resonate today, confirming their status as crucial contributors to modern African and diasporic black arts and letters.",,foundational african writers | simon gikandi,

Brendon Nicholls argues that mechanisms of gender subordination are strategically crucial to Ngugi's ideological project from his first novel to his most recent one. Nicholls describes the historical pressures that lead Ngugi to represent women as he does, and shows that the novels themselves are symptomatic of the cultural conditions that they address. Reading Ngugi's fiction in terms of its Gikuyu allusions and references, a gendered narrative of history emerges that creates transgressive spaces for women. Nicholls bases his discussion on moments during the Mau Mau rebellion when women's contributions to the anticolonial struggle could not be reduced to a patriarchal narrative of Kenyan history, and this interpretive maneuver permits a reading of Ngugi's fiction that accommodates female political and sexual agency. Nicholls contributes to postcolonial theory by proposing a methodology for reading cultural difference. This methodology critiques cultural practices like clitoridectomy in an ethical manner that seeks to avoid both cultural imperialism and cultural relativisim. His strategy of 'performative reading,' that is, making the conditions of one text (such as folklore, history, or translation) active in another (for example, fiction, literary narrative, or nationalism), makes possible an ethical reading of gender and of the conditions of reading in translation.",,this time tomorrow | ngugi wa thiong o,

It includes commentary essays on aspects of Abdilatif Abdalla’s work and life, through inter-weaving perspectives on poetry and politics, language and history; with contributions by East African writers and scholars of Swahili literature, including Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Said Khamis, Ken Walibora, Ahmed Rajab, Mohamed Bakari, and Sheikh Abdilahi Nassir, among others. Abdalla became famous in 1973, with the publication of Sauti ya Dhiki (Voice of Agony), a collection of poems written secretly in prison during three years of solitary confinement (1969-72). He was convicted of circulating pamphlets against Jomo Kenyatta’s KANU government, criticizing it as ‘dictatorial’ and calling for political resistance in the pamphlet, 'Kenya: Twendapi?' (Kenya: where are we heading?). His poetry epitomizes the ongoing currency of classic Swahili form and language, while his work overall, including translations and editorships, exemplifies a two-way mediation between ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ perspectives. It makes old and new voices of Swahili poetry and African literature accessible to a wider readership in East Africa, and beyond. Abdalla has lived in exile since 1973, in Tanzania, London, and subsequently, until now, in Germany. Nevertheless, Swahili literature and Kenyan politics have remained central to his life.",,a statement given by abdilatif abdalla chief co ordinator of the united movement for democracy in kenya to the 7th pan african congress kampala uganda on 3 8 april 1994 | abdilatif abdalla,

In How Art Can Be Thought Allan deSouza investigates such questions and the popular terminology through which art is discussed, valued, and taught. Adapting art viewing to contemporary demands within a rapidly changing world, deSouza outlines how art functions as politicized culture within a global industry. In addition to offering new pedagogical strategies for MFA programs and the training of artists, he provides an extensive analytical glossary of some of the most common terms used to discuss art while focusing on their current and changing usage. He also shows how these terms may be crafted to new artistic and social practices, particularly in what it means to decolonize the places of display and learning. DeSouza's work will be invaluable to the casual gallery visitor and the arts professional alike, to all those who regularly look at, think about, and make art—especially art students and faculty, artists, art critics, and curators.",,how art can be thought | allan desouza,9225223.0

The authors not only highlight the role of legislative measures and other human rights regulations in the realisation of international treaty rights but also argue that it creates an environment whereby individuals feel duty-bound to pay taxes, when necessary, thereby securing a sustainable revenue source for the state to meet their socio-economic responsibilities.

This book makes fascinating what might seem at first glance complex. It describes diverse approaches that have been adjusted to local circumstances across the continent and reflects on the push to unite and harmonise toward African union. Africa is rich, yet resources are lost through loopholes in fiscal systems. Financial resources come from the people, are not unlimited, and do not come easily or without cost. Africans must therefore cherish these resources and use them in nation-building and national and regional development. Efficient, effective, transparent and accountable fiscal systems that are fair and just will go a long way toward financing Africa’s development. Using examples from all of Africa’s 54 countries, the book makes fiscal matters real and understandable for people, no matter their field.

Above all, the political challenges of recovery and structural reform have raised core issues of burden-sharing and social equity on the agendas of both civil society groups and political elites. Democratic states need tax revenue to fund public goods and combat public “bads” with any degree of legitimacy.

Outside the walls, a vast Roman army waits. Yet the cityâ€™s incredible defences, designed by Archimedes, mean that Syracuse will not be taken easily.

A veteran of the bitter war since its beginning, Quintus is ready to give his life in the service of the Republic. But dangers face him from within his own ranks as well as from the enemy â€“ who include his former friend, the Carthaginian, Hanno.

Hanno has been sent by his general Hannibal to aid Syracuse in its fight against Rome. Pledged to bring death to all Romans, he is diverted from his mission by the discovery of Quintusâ€™ sister Aurelia, a captive within the city.

Two friends on opposing sides. A woman caught between them. They are about to meet in one of the most brutal sieges of all time.

Die Berichte Ã¼ber die Greueltaten der War Lords und ihrer Milizen gingen um die Welt. Andreas Herzau hat den BÃ¼rgerkrieg und die FlÃ¼chtlingsbewegungen damals vor Ort als Reporter erlebt und dokumentiert. Als in den Jahren 2005/06 ein erstaunlicher Aufarbeitungs- und Demokratisierungsprozess in Liberia einsetzte, besuchte er das Land erneut, stellte bald aber fest, dass diese Geschehnisse in der westlichen Welt auf weit weniger Interesse stieÃŸen als die 'Sensationen des Negativen'.0Ihm wurde deutlich, wie sehr das europÃ¤ische Bild von Afrika durch den Fokus auf Kriege und Krisen geprÃ¤gt ist. Sobald sich die Situation in einem der LÃ¤nder zum Guten wendet, berichtet niemand mehr darÃ¼ber. Bestand haben einzig die Bilder und Nachrichten von Greueltaten, Chaos, Hunger und Opfern. Herzau bemerkte, dass diese 'dÃ©formation professionelle' auch seinen Blick bestimmte. Er beschloss daraufhin, ein Experiment zu wagen und das Land 2019 unter anderen Vorzeichen zu betrachten. Das Ziel war, in Erfahrung zu bringen, ob es ihm gelinge, Liberia mit einem Interesse am Positiven zu bereisen und eine optische Sprache dafÃ¼r zu finden. Das vorliegenden Buch stellt im Wortsinn einen Versuch dar, sich der zementierenden Wirkung einseitiger Opferberichterstattung entgegenzustellen und dem Stereotyp des europÃ¤ischen Afrikabildes zu entkommen.

A man from nowhere,Elspeth Huxley,,,,,1964.0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6943148-L.jpg,ol_author,"British Decolonisation and the Female Middlebrow Novel offers the first detailed discussion of middlebrow fiction by women writers who personally witnessed the dismantling of the British Empire, the intensification of the Cold War, and the domestic tensions following the arrival of thousands of migrants from Britain’s former colonies. Studying selected novels by Cecilie Leslie, Elspeth Huxley, Mary McMinnies, Han Suyin and Kamala Markandaya, this study demonstrates that women’s middlebrow writing reveals a much deeper engagement with the politics and economics of decolonisation than is usually ascribed to the genre. As Anne Wetherilt argues, by transcending the politics of domesticity, the female middlebrow registers a critique of both Britain’s colonial history and mainstream conceptions of decolonisation as a well-managed transition from empire to commonwealth. As such, the middlebrow novel of the immediate post-war decades takes us back to a place where the end of empire was imagined rather than denied, and the ambiguities of British colonial politics exposed, rather than repressed.",,a man from nowhere | elspeth huxley,6943148.0

The walled city,Elspeth Huxley,,,,,1948.0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9692161-L.jpg,ol_author,"This third volume of ASNEL Papers covers a wide range of theoretical and thematic approaches to the subject of intertextuality. Intertextual relations between oral and written versions of literature, text and performance, as well as problems emerging from media transitions, regionally instructed forms of intertextuality, and the works of individual authors are equally dealt with. Intertextuality as both a creative and a critical practice frequently exposes the essential arbitrariness of literary and cultural manifestations that have become canonized. The transformation and transfer of meanings which accompanies any crossing between texts rests not least on the nature of the artistic corpus embodied in the general framework of historically and socially determined cultural traditions. Traditions, however, result from selective forms of perception; they are as much inventions as they are based on exclusion. Intertextuality leads to a constant reinforcement of tradition, while, at the same time, intertextual relations between the new literatures and other English-language literatures are all too obvious. Despite the inevitable impact of tradition, the new literatures tend to employ a dynamic reading of culture which fosters social process and transition, thus promoting transcultural rather than intercultural modes of communication. Writing and reading across borders becomes a dialogue which reveals both differences and similarities. More than a decolonizing form of deconstruction, intertextuality is a strategy for communicating meaning across cultural boundaries.",,the walled city | elspeth huxley,9692161.0

She draws on her knowledge of Kenya and its literature to present an anthology that gives a fully-rounded portrait of a nation, its people and wildlife, its history and landscape and the men and women who made their mark upon it. Divided into nine sections, each covering a different aspect of Kenya, and including the work of writers as diverse as Karen Blixen, Richard Leakey, Evelyn Waugh, Shiva Naipaul and Winston Churchill, Nine Faces of Kenya is the ideal introduction to the country. Kenya is a land of great contrasts, the home of many of the most interesting African peoples and the place where many of Africa's most beautiful animals live.

But on the slopes of the mountain, in densest forest, the people of Kamasai lived completely cut off. The houses were built among the boulders. There were no grassy plains for cattle to graze on. The little grass they could obtain was found in gaps in the forest canopy where the trees allowed the sunlight to filter down.

This story starts with her childhood in the 20s and 30s on a Kenyan coffee farm. Brought up by her father's black servants and white governesses, much of her time was spent riding and with the tame wild animals. This was the White Mischief era, when parents were busy partying and children lived their own hidden lives. But there was school to attend in Europe and later South Africa, a different establishment each year, where she struggled to speak English instead of Swahili. There was finishing school in Switzerland, and even in Kenya the less innocent adult life began to encroach on her African idyll. At fifteen she became involved in the Lord Erroll affair and is the only person to whom Delves Broughton confessed to the murder of Lord Erroll.",,child of happy valley | juanita carberry,

Without denying Christianity’s contribution to the stigma, discrimination, and exclusion of same-sex-attracted and gender-variant people on the continent, Adriaan van Klinken presents an alternative narrative, foregrounding the ways in which religion also appears as a critical site of LGBT activism. Taking up the notion of “arts of resistance,” Kenyan, Christian, Queer presents four case studies of grassroots LGBT activism through artistic and creative expressions—including the literary and cultural work of Binyavanga Wainaina, the “Same Love” music video produced by gay gospel musician George Barasa, the Stories of Our Lives anthology project, and the LGBT-affirming Cosmopolitan Affirming Church. Through these case studies, Van Klinken demonstrates how Kenyan traditions, black African identities, and Christian beliefs and practices are being navigated, appropriated, and transformed in order to allow for queer Kenyan Christian imaginations. Transdisciplinary in scope and poignantly intimate in tone, Kenyan, Christian, Queer opens up critical avenues for rethinking the nature and future of the relationship between Christianity and queer activism in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa.",,boldly queer | theo sandfort,

With determination born of suffering, Koigi wa Wamwere documents the brutality of the colonial years. He describes the physical and emotional abuse visited on his parents and others by the plundering British.

Tracing the roots of the Mau Mau rebellion and the strict curfews and violence of the colonial government, wa Wamwere follows the evolution and degeneration of Jomo Kenyatta and the rise of Daniel arap Moi. During those years, wa Wamwere began to speak out and fight for human rights. In 1979 he won a seat in the parliament, where he represented the economically depressed Nakuru district for three years. His history is infused with freedom songs of his people and revealing allegories born out of the Kenyan storytelling tradition.

As an activist, a journalist, and a member of the Kenyan parliament, wa Wamwere was framed and detained on three separate instances, spending thirteen years in prison, where he was tortured but not broken. His mother and other mothers led a hunger strike to free him and fellow political prisoners. Their efforts brought about a show trial where wa Wamwere was sentenced to four more years in prison and six strokes of the cane. Under such a sentence, others had died from abuse to body and spirit. But, buoyed by a growing chorus of international support, wa Wamwere refused his fate.

The genocide in Rwanda and ""ethnic"" killing in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and elsewhere stand out as examples. Wa Wamwere argues that these clashes cannot properly be described as ethnically motivated; ethnicity, a positive distinction, has nothing of the hatred here at work. Negative Ethnicity gives a new picture of the force behind untold deaths on the continent, dispelling the myth of an intractable conflict waged along simple, ancient lines. Negative Ethnicity explains the roots, colonial and pre-colonial, of the current ""ethnic"" tensions. It goes on to describe how, for most Africans, ethnic identity is ambiguous, and analyzes why that fact is obscured. The culprits are many: chronic poverty, a broken education system, preying dictators, corrupt officials, the colonial legacy of hate, the ongoing exploitation of the West. Negative Ethnicity is both a history and a manual for change, intended to introduce Westerners to the crisis and to give Africans a new understanding of it. Perhaps never before has the problem been addressed with such clarity and insight.",,negative ethnicity | koigi wa wamwere,

The essays frame ethics as a historical phenomenon best examined as a historical movement, the dynamic ethos of a people, rather than as a theoretical construct.

Gods Leading Lady,Rev. Lucy Natasha,,,,,2018.0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9178734-L.jpg,ol_author,"Rev. Lucy Natasha delves into the lives of eight Bible women who walked in God's special fa-vour that ushered them into positions of honour, obtained mercy that made them whole, received wisdom and excelled in leadership roles, experienced joy unspeakable because of God's promises being fulfilled in their lives. Amongst us are women battling with fears, insecurities, ailments, shame and all manner of misfortunes but just like these eight women, God's grace has been made available and their testimonies can as well be replicated in the life of Jackie, Stella, Amanda or the girl next door. Christ, our Kinsman Redeemer awaits with arms wide open to offer victory, restoration and a new life. Rev. Natasha ministers encouragement and hope to every woman and man who is caught up in the web of lies that satan often throws around with the intention of robbing God's children of their Kingdom identity and destiny. Every chapter in God's Leading Lady emphasises the fact that God cannot be limited or hindered by age, race or social status. He can use anyone who is obedi-ent and fully surrendered to walk in the pathways of His perfect will. Spread across the pages of this book is a message of Jehovah's limitless power, enduring faithfulness and sufficient grace that should inspire us to arise and shine because our light has come.

The Yearâ€™s Best African Speculative Fiction 2021,Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki,,,,,2021.0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14845594-L.jpg,ol_author,"The Year's Best African Speculative Fiction (2021), edited by the award-winning Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, is not just a book; it's a gateway to the diverse and rich world of African speculative fiction. This anthology, a winner of the Best Anthology at the World Fantasy Awards, is a groundbreaking collection that brings together twenty-nine extraordinary stories by twenty-five talented writers from Africa and its diaspora. These stories represent some of the most exciting voices in the genre, both old and new, offering readers a journey through imaginative landscapes filled with wonder, insight, and a deep understanding of the human and beyond-human experience. 

The anthology is a celebration of African speculative fiction, marking a significant moment in the genre. It is the first of its kind, highlighting the breadth and depth of talent that exists within the African speculative fiction community. The collection includes tales from a range of authors, including Somto O. Ihezue, Pemi Aguda, Russell Nichols, Tamara JerÃ©e, Tlotlo Tsamaase, and many others, each contributing their unique voice and vision. The stories navigate themes of identity, culture, and the complexities of the human spirit in ways that are both universal and deeply rooted in African experiences. 

Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, the editor, is not only a skilled anthologist but also a celebrated author in his own right. His work has received multiple accolades, including the Nommoaward and recognition as aNebula and Hugo award finalist. In editing this anthology, Ekpeki has opened a door to a realm of stories that challenge, entertain, and provoke thought, offering a vital platform for voices that are often underrepresented in the global speculative fiction landscape. 

This anthology is more than just a collection of stories; it is a testament to the power of speculative fiction to transcend boundaries and explore new horizons. It is highly recommended for anyone looking to delve into a world where the speculative meets the vibrantly diverse tapestry of African storytelling. Whether you're a long-time fan of speculative fiction or new to the genre, The Year's Best African Speculative Fiction (2021) is bound to leave you wonderstruck and eager for more.",,the yearaEUR(tm)s best african speculative fiction 2021 | oghenechovwe donald ekpeki,14845594.0
The Yearâ€™s Best African Speculative Fiction 2023,Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki,,,,,2024.0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14845593-L.jpg,ol_author,"This is the third volume in this highly praised series (the first won the World Fantasy Award). Previous works have been praised for their eclectic mix of stories, offering a panorama of themes and styles. For instance, the 2021 edition included a story about a woman struggling with her identity and relationship in the face of a thought-recording device, a tale of a man fostering a rapidly evolving robot, and an adventurous narrative about a sentient robot dog engaging in space piracy. These stories not only explored advanced technologies and speculative scenarios but also delved deep into human emotions, relationships, and societal issues.

Themes of personal struggles, such as dealing with depression, anxiety, and feelings of alienation, were also prominent. These were manifested through unique and powerful metaphors, like a woman whose detachable body parts symbolized her sense of disintegration and invisibility, or a story that portrayed the torment of self-contempt through the constant barrage of negative thoughts from imaginary entities.

The anthology also ventured into mythic dimensions, echoing the voices and histories of entire cultures through concise yet profound storytelling. For example, flash fiction pieces in the collection reached the heights of epic poetry, encapsulating the journey of human life and cultural evolution.

With such a backdrop, the 2023 volume continues this tradition of blending speculative elements with profound human experiences and cultural narratives. It's likely to feature stories that push the boundaries of imagination while staying grounded in the complexities of the human condition. Readers can anticipate a collection that entertains, provokes thought, and offers new perspectives on the future and the present. The anthology is not just a showcase of speculative fiction; it's a celebration of African storytelling, creativity, and the endless possibilities within the realm of speculative fiction.",,the yearaEUR(tm)s best african speculative fiction 2023 | oghenechovwe donald ekpeki,14845593.0

Like their country, this group of old women is divided by ethnicity, language, class, and religion.

But around the charcoal fire at the Refuge, the old-age home they share in Nairobi, they uncover the hidden personal histories that connect them as women: stories of their struggles for self-determination; of conflict, violence, and loss, but also of survival. As a visitor to the Refuge says, ""To be eighty years old in Africa is to be tough, particularly for a woman."" And these seven women, with no families to care for them, must be tougher still.""--BOOK JACKET.",,the present moment | marjorie oludhe macgoye,4528703.0

Using logbooks, newspapers, and numerous other sources, this book pieces together the multifaceted and largely unknown history of the Tamar . From her launch into service to her roles as a hospital, theatre stage, and transport for military personnel, the Tamar carried not just people, but also their mundane dreams and ambitions— for friends, families, and staying alive. Any ideas or concerns about sustaining the empire seldom featured in their minds at all, but it was this empire that the Tamar served for seventy-nine years, steaming the equivalent of thirty-two times around the Earth and transporting tens of thousands of people to what would seem to them another world. In this engaging narrative, the Tamar’s exploits and the experiences of her crew and passengers parallel those of the British Empire and its subjects, bringing to life the realities of imperial life on land and at sea. As mud continues to settle over the Tamar’s forgotten remains in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour, Transport to Another World will appeal to historians and readers interested in maritime history and colonial Hong Kong in general, and makes a case for conserving the memory of a past some would prefer to forget.",,campaign and be damned | marjorie wallace,

Using globalization, postmodern and postcolonial theories the book deconstructs the long-held myths about NGO inviolability, and opens ground for understanding their strengths. It interrogates sites of contestation, apprehension and possibilities that the RF has produced. Using RF projects, it looks at structures of hegemony, race, power, class and gender that the RF has created. The book illustrates the extent to which the RF has been instrumental in spreading capitalism, imperialism in economic, political, cultural and social realms through globalization.

Kurtz has also put together the first annotated bibliography of all the anglophone Kenyan novels that have appeared since Ngugi wa Thiong'o wrote Weep Not, Child.Ngugi's Weep Not, Child made an immediate impact on its publication in 1964. Since then hundreds of novels by Kenyans have been published. This is a comprehensive introduction to the postcolonial novel in English. Three broad areas are identified: -- the first generation of the sixties -- the 'golden age' of the seventies -- and the years after Kenyatta in the 80s and 90sA unifying feature is an uneasy but marked emphasis on the city-particularly Nairobi. The city is used by novelists as both the site and the symbol for a range of obsessions and fears about postcolonial society. There is particular emphasis on the changing ways in which the city has been portrayed since Ngugi's first novel, the relation of popular literature to the city, the portrayal of women in the city and the special status of Meja Mwangi's urban novels.",,the eighth wife | miriam khamadi were,

The East African public transport vehicle from which Matatu takes its name is both a component and a symbol of these modernities: based on ""Western"" (these days usually Japanese) technology, it is a vigorously African institution; it is usually regarded with some anxiety by those travelling in it, but is often enough the only means of transport available; it creates temporary communicative communities and provides a transient site for the exchange of news, storytelling, and political debate. Matatu is firmly committed to supporting democratic change in Africa, to providing a forum for interchanges between African and European critical debates, to overcoming notions of absolute cultural, ethnic, or religious alterity, and to promoting transnational discussion on the future of African societies in a wider world.

Her incisive yet moving prose unpacks the injustices shaping Covid’s starkly different outcomes between countries and communities, and reveals rich societies’ shockingly inaccurate view of how her home continent has fared. From the hidden truth of fast action, mutual aid and transnational cooperation in poorer countries to the widespread falsehoods of Western commentary, Nyabola exposes a global society scarred by colonial legacies, lazy narratives and ingrained biases. These essays are an inventory of the staggering political and social failures of our time, and the myths exposed in Covid’s wake. Watching coronavirus spread in Kenya and around the world, Nyabola reflects on a long history of onlookers denying the Global South’s agency and successes in times of emergency. Armed with her insider-outsider perspective, she reveals harsh truths about our broken system, and calls powerfully for a sincerely shared post-pandemic world—one where voices like hers can help to write a real global history.",,strange and difficult times | nanjala nyabola,

And, as in Western nations, the digital age has had dramatic effects on society and politics. Yet, while we hear about the #MeToo movement and the Russian bot scandal, there is little appreciation for the feminist movement #MyDressMyChoice and the subversion of state-run political propaganda by social media. Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics aims to change this by presenting a unique contribution to the debate on digital democracy. For traditionally marginalized groups, particularly women and the disabled, digital spaces have provided vital platforms that allow Kenyans to build new communities that transcend old ethnic and gender divisions. Covering attempts by political elites to prevent social movements from translating online visibility into meaningful offline gains, Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics explores the drastic efforts to contain online activism and new methods of feminist mobilization, as well as how ""fake news,"" Cambridge Analytica, and allegations of hacking contributed to tensions around the 2017 elections.

This moving collection demonstrates the significant legacy of the writer and activist who spoke truth to power during the era of the fight for Black civil liberties in the US, and after. In this literary anthology, over 30 contributors reveal the influence of Baldwin’s thought, speech and writing to their personal journeys and their awareness of the need for social justice. Stella Dadzie was born in 1952 in London, United Kingdom. She co-founded the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), which worked relentlessly between 1978 and 1982 to challenge the predominantly white domination of the feminist and women’s liberation movements of that era. Additionally, her work extended beyond the written word into practical action, contributing to the enrichment of curriculums and development of anti-racist strategies in educational and youth services. “... the words of this remarkable collection are breath blown back to our beloved ancestor James Baldwin, and he to them, to us: air we breathe, air we need, for these troubled times.” — Kevin Powell – GRAMMY-nominated poet and activist “From reflective pieces, interviews, essays, and poetic interventions, Encounters with James Baldwin confirms the enduring resonance of the life and work of James Baldwin across the globe. This is an important text for readers eager to consider the expansive legacy of arguably the most piercing and committed author and critic of the last century.” — Rich Blint, writer and critic",,city murders | nducu wa ngugi,

It is widely accepted that the elections were deeply flawed, and that there was electoral malfeasance by all the major players. President Kibaki's rapid declaration of victory in the face of a heavily disputed election and his determination to hold on to the levers of state power precipitated a deadly crisis, communal violence and economic decline. A power-sharing deal between Kibaki and Opposition leader, Raila Odinga signed in February seems to be holding, but Kenya ranks among the worlds’ growing number of democracies at-risk. This book takes a new look at the 2007 election, the post-election crisis, the underlying interaction of ethnicity, class and political power; forced displacement, the role of international forces; and the country’s power-sharing arrangement. The study will draw upon the expertise of a variety of leading experts on Kenya, and will be edited by Peter Kagwanja and Roger Southall. The overall project was based on a workshop in Nairobi on 6-7 December 2008. This book was published as a special issue of the Journal of Contemporary African Studies.",,kenya s uncertain democracy | peter kagwanja,

Specifically, the paper examines Pretoria's involvement in Africa, and its internal capacity to support its mediation, peacekeeping and strengthening of the abilities of African institutions for peacemaking. Further, it examines the challenges posed by tension between its pan-African and economic interests as well as power rivalry at the continental level, which have greatly limited its ability to play a more assertive role in regional political and economic developments. Since its transition from apartheid to democracy in April 1994, South Africa has been an increasingly important player in peace promotion activities across the continent. Because of its moral power arising from its unique transition from apartheid to democracy, and its military and economic might, South Africa is widely viewed as being in the same league as other global middle-sized powers, and as a regional 'superpower'.",,an encumbered regional power? | peter kagwanja,

It is widely accepted that the elections were deeply flawed, and that there was electoral malfeasance by all the major players. President Kibaki's rapid declaration of victory in the face of a heavily disputed election and his determination to hold on to the levers of state power precipitated a deadly crisis, communal violence and economic decline. A power-sharing deal between Kibaki and Opposition leader, Raila Odinga signed in February seems to be holding, but Kenya ranks among the worlds’ growing number of democracies at-risk. This book takes a new look at the 2007 election, the post-election crisis, the underlying interaction of ethnicity, class and political power; forced displacement, the role of international forces; and the country’s power-sharing arrangement. The study will draw upon the expertise of a variety of leading experts on Kenya, and will be edited by Peter Kagwanja and Roger Southall. The overall project was based on a workshop in Nairobi on 6-7 December 2008. This book was published as a special issue of the Journal of Contemporary African Studies.",,eye on the nation | peter kagwanja,

Lords of Impunity is an in-depth analysis of recent crises and events that the United Nations failed to tackle adequately, with a special focus on the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements. It reveals how white privilege, misogyny and a culture of impunity at the UN create a toxic work environment that even impacts how UN projects and programs are implemented. The book debunks the myth that the United Nations is a club of equals committed to preventing wars and protecting the world's most vulnerable people.

UNsilenced shows that, in fact, the UN has remained a bystander in many of these conflicts and that peace-building efforts have not only been undermined by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, but also by the UNs many agencies and programmes. The book exposes how, under the guise of development, stability and the war on terror, the UN fails to prevent conflicts in many parts of the world, and in some cases, misleads the public about the scale of a problem. The book also reveals the web of lies, cover-ups, corruption and impunity within the United Nations that has allowed wrongdoing to continue unabated. Many of these acts of wrongdoing occur or continue because the UN fails to protect whistleblowers; on the contrary, most UN whistleblowers experience severe retaliation. UNsilenced describes how whistleblowers have been denied justice within the UN system and how the immunity accorded to UN officials and the conflict of interest inherent in the UNs internal justice system allow the perpetrators of criminal or unethical activities to go unpunished. The book is an urgent call for a serious reform of this bureaucratic, arcane and increasingly politicized organization because not doing so constitutes a betrayal of the trust invested in it by the people and countries that depend on it.",,unsilenced | rasna warah,14848269.0

All the contributors to this anthology approach the notion of development through their own worldviews and experiences: many are convinced that it is time to declare the death of development as an idea, as an ideology, and as an industry. The essays in this book come from various writers, most of whom are either based in East Africa, or are part of its diaspora, or who have worked, often as developmentalists in their own way, within Africa. Consequently, this extremely accessible collection does not attempt the grand sweep, raging aimlessly against the development machine with general complaints that fail to hit their mark. Rather, it is a focused peep into international, regional and local attempts to develop Africa, thereby exposing the reader to a much-needed African perspective on the development industry and why it has failed so miserably in lifting millions of people out of poverty.",,missionaries mercenaries and misfits | rasna warah,10685855.0

The city has a long history that dates back to the 10th century when Arab and Persian traders began settling there. For centuries, Mogadishu was a traditional centre for Islam and an important hub for trade with communities along the Indian Ocean coastline. However, since the beginning of the civil war in the early 1990s, Somalia's capital city has gained the reputation of being the most dangerous and violent city in the world. Mogadishu Then and Now is an attempt to redeem the city's damaged reputation and restore its lost glory in the public imagination and in the Somali people's collective memory. The book showcases Mogadishu in all its splendour prior to the civil war and contrasts this with the devastation and destruction that has characterised the city for more than two decades. It should be of particular interest to historians, urban planners, architects and and anthropologists.",,mogadishu then and now | rasna warah,10685052.0

One of the cornerstones of NgÅ©gÄ© wa ThiongÊ¼o's fame, Devil on the Cross was written in secret, on toilet paper, while NgÅ©gÄ© wa ThiongÊ¼o was in prison. It tells the tragic story of Wariinga, a young woman who moves from a rural Kenyan town to the capital, Nairobi, only to be exploited by her boss and later by a corrupt businessman. As she struggles to survive, Wariinga begins to realize that her problems are only symptoms of a larger societal malaise and that much of the misfortune stems from the Western, capitalist influences on her country. An impassioned cry for a Kenya free of dictatorship and for African writers to work in their own local dialects, Devil on the Cross has had a profound influence on Africa and on post-colonial African literature""--",,caitaani mutharaba ini | ngugi wa thiong o,14338902.0
