There is hope—but only if we listen to the science before it's too late. In The Climate Book, Greta Thunberg has gathered the wisdom of over one hundred experts—geophysicists, oceanographers and meteorologists; engineers, economists and mathematicians; historians, philosophers and Indigenous leaders—to equip us all with the knowledge we need to combat climate disaster. Alongside them, she shares her own stories of demonstrating and uncovering greenwashing around the world, revealing how much we have been kept in the dark. This is one of our biggest challenges, she shows, but also our greatest source of hope. Once we are given the full picture, how can we not act?

Written and oral verbal art are often regarded as dichotomies, one excluding the other. While orature is confused with 'tradition', literature is ascribed to modernity. Furthermore, local languages are ignored and literature is equated with writing in foreign languages. The contributions in this volume take issue with such preconceptions and explore the multiple ways in which literary and oral forms interrelate and subvert each other, giving birth to new forms of artistic expression. They emphasize the local agency of the African poet and writer, which resists the global commodification of literature through the international bestseller lists of the cultural industry. The first section traces the movement from oral to written texts, which in many cases coincides with a switch from African to European languages. But as the essays in the section on ""New Literary Languages"" make clear, in other cases a true philological work is accomplished in the African language to create a new written and literary medium. Through the mixing of languages in the cities, such as the Sheng spoken in Kenya or the bilinguality of a writer such as Cheik Aliou Ndao (Senegal), new idioms for literary expressions evolve. The use of new media, technology or music stimulate the emergence of new genres, such as Taarab in East Africa, radio poetry in Yoruba and Hausa, or Rap in the Senegal, as is shown in the section on ""Forms of New Orality."" It is a great achievement of this second volume of Versions and Subversions in African Literatures that it assembles contributions by scholars from the anglophone and the francophone world and that it covers literary production in a broad spectrum of languages: English, French, Hausa, Sheng, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Wolof and Yoruba.

Coundouriotis argues that this genre, aimed more specifically at African readers than the continent’s better-known bildungsroman tradition, nevertheless makes an important intervention in global understandings of human rights. The African war novel lies at the convergence of two sensibilities it encounters in European traditions: the naturalist aesthetic and the discourse of humanitarianism, whether in the form of sentimentalism or of human rights law. Both these sensibilities are present in culturally hybrid forms in the African war novel, reflecting its syncretism as a narrative practice engaged with the colonial and postcolonial history of the continent. The war novel, Coundouriotis argues, stakes claims to collective rights that contrast with the individualism of the bildungsroman tradition.

Nowhere is this fusion more evident than in the formation of Swahili, Eastern Africa's lingua franca, and its cultures. Swahili Beyond the Boundaries: Literature, Language, and Identity addresses the moving frontiers of Swahili literature under the impetus of new waves of globalization in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. These momentous changes have generated much theoretical debate on several literary fronts, as Swahili literature continues to undergo transformation in the mill of human creativity. Swahili literature is a hybrid that is being reconfigured by a conjuncture of global and local forces. As the interweaving of elements of the colonizer and the colonized, this hybrid formation provides a representation of cultural difference that is said to constitute a ""third space,"" blurring existing boundaries and calling into question established identitarian categorizations. This cultural dialectic is clearly evident in the Swahili literary experience as it has evolved in the crucible of the politics of African cultural production. However, Swahili Beyond the Boundaries demonstrates that, from the point of view of Swahili literature, while hybridity evokes endless openness on questions of home and identity, it can simultaneously put closure on specific forms of subjectivity. In the process of this contestation, a new synthesis may be emerging that is poised to subject Swahili literature to new kinds of challenges in the politics of identity, compounded by the dynamics and counterdynamics of post-Cold War globalization.",,uhuru wa watumwa | james mbotela,,uhuru wa watumwa,james mbotela,,,"Uhuru wa Watumwa

But, as this book argues, Africa faces three major opportunities that can transform its agriculture into a force for economic growth: advances in science and technology; the creation of regional markets; and the emergence of a new crop of entrepreneurial leaders dedicated to the continent's economic improvement. Filled with case studies from within Africa and success stories from developing nations around the world, The New Harvest outlines the policies and institutional changes necessary to promote agricultural innovation across the African continent. Incorporating research from academia, government, civil society, and private industry, the book suggests multiple ways that individual African countries can work together at the regional level to develop local knowledge and resources, harness technological innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, increase agricultural output, create markets, and improve infrastructure.",,the new harvest: agricultural innovation in africa | calestous juma,,the new harvest agricultural innovation in africa,calestous juma,2011.0,05-14,"The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa

By looking at how writers of African descent have presented the practice in their literary work, Elisabeth Bekers shows how the debate on female genital excision evolved over the last four decades of the twentieth century, in response to changing attitudes about ethnicity, nationalism, colonialism, feminism, and human rights. Rising Anthills (the title refers to a Dogon myth) analyzes works in English, French, and Arabic by African and African American writers, both women and men, from different parts of the African continent and the diaspora. Attending closely to the nuances of language and the complexities of the issue, Bekers explores lesser-known writers side by side with such recognizable names as Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Flora Nwapa, Nawal El Saadawi, Ahmadou Kourouma, Calixthe Beyala, Alice Walker, and Gloria Naylor. Following their literary discussions of female genital excision, she discerns a gradual evolution—from the 1960s, when writers mindful of its communal significance carefully “wrote around” the physical operation, through the 1970s and 1980s, when they began to speak out against the practice and their societies’ gender politics, to the late 1990s, when they situated their denunciations of female genital excision in a much broader, international context of women’s oppression and the struggle for women’s rights.",,the scar : a tragedy in one act | rebeka njau,,the scar a tragedy in one act,rebeka njau,,,"The scar : a tragedy in one act

Brendon Nicholls argues that mechanisms of gender subordination are strategically crucial to Ngugi's ideological project from his first novel to his most recent one. Nicholls describes the historical pressures that lead Ngugi to represent women as he does, and shows that the novels themselves are symptomatic of the cultural conditions that they address. Reading Ngugi's fiction in terms of its Gikuyu allusions and references, a gendered narrative of history emerges that creates transgressive spaces for women. Nicholls bases his discussion on moments during the Mau Mau rebellion when women's contributions to the anticolonial struggle could not be reduced to a patriarchal narrative of Kenyan history, and this interpretive maneuver permits a reading of Ngugi's fiction that accommodates female political and sexual agency. Nicholls contributes to postcolonial theory by proposing a methodology for reading cultural difference. This methodology critiques cultural practices like clitoridectomy in an ethical manner that seeks to avoid both cultural imperialism and cultural relativisim. His strategy of 'performative reading,' that is, making the conditions of one text (such as folklore, history, or translation) active in another (for example, fiction, literary narrative, or nationalism), makes possible an ethical reading of gender and of the conditions of reading in translation.",,matigari ma njiruungi | ngugi wa thiong o,,matigari ma njiruungi,ngugi wa thiong o,1986.0,80-94,"Matigari ma Njiruungi

Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation’s highest office. Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.",,a promised land | barack obama,,a promised land,barack obama,2020.0,15-19,"A Promised Land

This is what Henry Rono is known for. However, it is not who Henry Rono is. Henry Rono was born a poor Nandi in Kenya's Rift Valley. After an accident when he was two, doctors believed he would never again walk. This would be the first of countless obstacles Rono would have to overcome in order to pursue his two life goals: to first become the greatest runner in the world and then to become the best teacher he could be. Rono's first goal was accomplished in 1978, when he was considered not only the greatest track-and-field athlete in the world, but also by many to be the world's greatest athlete period. His second and greater goal, to become a teacher, was more difficult in coming. Once Rono became a star, coaches, agents, meet directors, and corrupt Kenyan athletic officials (whose boycotts of the 1976 and 1980 Olympics turned Rono's dreams of Olympic gold into Olympic smoke rings), wanted him to serve as their personal moneymaker, and so they did everything they could to discourage Rono's pursuit of an education and dream of teaching. The corruption and discouragement Rono encountered, as well as his alienation and exile from his homeland and family, pushed him to 20 years of alcoholism and even occasional homelessness. This is the life story of Henry Rono, whose descent from triumph to abyss, and whose subsequent ascent from abyss to triumph, are perhaps steeper than those of any track-and field athlete in history.",,olympic dream | henry rono,,olympic dream,henry rono,2007.0,05-14,"Olympic Dream

At the age of sixteen, Paulina leaves her small village in western Kenya to join her new husband, Martin, in the bustling city of Nairobi. It is 1956, and Kenya is in the final days of the ""Emergency,"" as the British seek to suppress violent anti-colonial revolts. But Paulina knows little about, about city life, or about marriage, and Martin’s clumsy attempts to control her soon lead to a relationship filled with silences, misunderstandings, and unfulfilled expectations. Soon Paulina’s inability to bear a child effectively banishes her from the confines of traditional women’s roles. As her country at last moves toward independence, Paulina manages to achieve a kind of independence as well: She accepts a job that will require her to live separately from her husband, and she has an affair that leads to the birth of her first child. But Paulina’s hard-won contentment will be shattered when Kenya’s turbulent history intrudes into her private life, bringing with it tragedy—and a new test of her quiet courage and determination. Paulina’s patient struggles for survival and identity are revealed through Marjorie Macgoye’s keen and sensitive vision—a vision which extends to embrace the whole of a nation and a people likewise struggling to find their way. As the Weekly Standard of Kenya notes, ""Coming to Birth is a radical novel in firmly asserting our common humanity.""",978-0-435-90670-7,coming to birth | marjorie oludhe macgoye,,coming to birth,marjorie oludhe macgoye,1986.0,80-94,"Coming to birth

It is 1963 and Kenya is on the verge of Uhuru - Independence Day. The mighty british government has been toppled, and in the lull between the fighting and the new world, colonized and colonizer alike reflect on what they have gained and lost. In the village of Thabai, the men and women who live there have been transformed irrevocably by the uprising. Kihika, legendary rebel leader, was fatally betrayed to the whiteman. Gikonyo's marriage to the beautiful Mumbi was destroyed when he was imprisoned, while her life has been shattered in other ways. And Mugo, brave survivor of the camps and now a village hero, harbours a terrible secret. As events unfold, compromises are forced, friendships are betrayed and loves are tested. Kenyan novelist and playwright Ngugi wa Thiong'o is the author of Weep Not Child (1964), The River Between (1965), and Petals of Blood (1977). Ngugi was chair of the Department of Literature at the University of Nairobi from 1972 to 1977.

The authors in this book analyse historical trajectories of Kenya's nationalism trends while highlighting the role of political leaders, large as well as small ethnic groups, perennial conflicts, community as well as religious leaders, among others. The discussions demonstrate that quest for a national identity that is inclusive at all levels – whether politically, economically, religiously and ethnically – has marked Kenya's struggle for nationalism, sometimes leading to violence, especially during election periods, national unity through political coalitions and reconciliation, as well as institutional reforms.

But to the contrary, Slavery and the Culture of Taste demonstrates that these two areas of modernity were surprisingly entwined. Ranging across Britain, the antebellum South, and the West Indies, and examining vast archives, including portraits, period paintings, personal narratives, and diaries, Simon Gikandi illustrates how the violence and ugliness of enslavement actually shaped theories of taste, notions of beauty, and practices of high culture, and how slavery's impurity informed and haunted the rarified customs of the time. Gikandi focuses on the ways that the enslavement of Africans and the profits derived from this exploitation enabled the moment of taste in European--mainly British--life, leading to a transformation of bourgeois ideas regarding freedom and selfhood. He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure. Through a close look at the eighteenth century's many remarkable documents and artworks, Slavery and the Culture of Taste sets forth the tensions and contradictions entangling a brutal practice and the distinctions of civility.",,slavery and the culture of taste | simon gikandi,,slavery and the culture of taste,simon gikandi,2014.0,05-14,"Slavery and the Culture of Taste

Or should he continue to be a 'black hermit' in the town, visiting the night clubs with his friend, Jane? Should he be supporting the Africanist Party when people feel that the colonial oppression has just been replaced by another form? These are the dramatic conflicts in this play. Ngugi wa Thiong'o is best known internationally as a novelist as well as a playwright. He wrote ""This Time Tomorrow"" (published in African Short Stories), The Black Hermit (1968), and, with Micere Githae Mugo, The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (1976), all of which had great social and political impact. His detention without trial in 1978 was probably due to the staging of the Gikuyu play, ""Ngaahika Ndeenda"" at the Kamirithu Cultural Centre, co-authored with Ngugu wa Mirii. The play is published in English as I will Marry when I Want. Ngugi continues to strongly advocate writing in indigenous languages. His two titles - Caaitani Mutharabaini and A Grain of Wheat - were among the recipients of Africa's 100 Best Books of the 20th Century Award.",,mtawa mweusi | ngugi wa thiong o,,mtawa mweusi,ngugi wa thiong o,1970.0,60-79,"Mtawa Mweusi

Exiliado de su Kenia natal desde hace más de veinticinco años, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, uno de los escritores africanos más importantes de la actualidad, sitúa esta historia en la imaginaria República Libre de Aburiria. El soberano, dictador inamovible, semidiós y genial estadista, ejerce su poder a capricho sobre todo un país y se regocija en la contemplación de las encarnizadas luchas entre súbditos y ministros para gozar de su favor. El pueblo, sometido a la injusticia y el terror, deberá recurrir a la subversión para tratar de derrocar desde abajo el régimen del tirano. Cualquier arma es útil. Incluso la magia. Corrosiva, humorística y terrible, esta tragicomedia se vale de la rica tradición cuentística africana para analizar con agudeza la dramática realidad poscolonial del continente. El brujo del cuervo moldea las historias de los poderosos y de la gente corriente en un mosaico deslumbrante y confirma el alcance de la sorprendente obra de Ngugi wa Thiong'o. La crítica ha dicho... «Una cáustica sátira social y política de la corrupción de la sociedad africana con un toque de realismo mágico, o, tal vez, de magia realista.» Publishers Weekly «Una magistral narración de realismo mágico sobre la historia del África del siglo XX. Indiscutiblemente: una obra maestra.» Scotland on Sunday «Ambicioso, cáustico y apasionado.» New Yorker «La fuerza de El brujo del cuervo se manifiesta en el asombroso laberinto con que comienza cada capítulo, en la ambiciosa combinación de sátira, realismo social e imaginación sobrenatural.» Harper's Magazine «Una traviesa y alucinante sátira sobre un dictador.» Sunday Times «A lo largo de su intensa trayectoria, Ngugi ha formado parte de las paradigmáticas cuestiones y dilemas del escritor africano contemporáneo, tocando la situación política, social, racial y lingüística...

In one extended flashback he recalls the night, a year earlier, when armed police pulled him from his home and jailed him in Kenya's Kamĩtĩ Maximum Security Prison, one of the largest in Africa. There, he lives in a prison block with eighteen other political prisoners, quarantined from the general prison population. In a conscious effort to fight back the humiliation and the intended degradation of the spirit, Ngũgĩ—the world-renowned author of Weep Not, Child; Petals of Blood; and Wizard of the Crow—decides to write a novel on toilet paper, the only paper to which he has access, a book that will become his classic, Devil on the Cross. Written in the early 1980s and never before published in America, Wrestling with the Devil is Ngũgĩ's account of the drama and the challenges of writing the novel under twenty-four-hour surveillance. He captures not only the excruciating pain that comes from being cut off from his wife and children, but also the spirit of defiance that defines hope. Ultimately, Wrestling with the Devil is a testimony to the power of imagination to help humans break free of confinement, which is truly the story of all art.",,wrestling with the devil: a prison memoir | ngugi wa thiong o,,wrestling with the devil a prison memoir,ngugi wa thiong o,2018.0,15-19,"Wrestling with the Devil: A Prison Memoir

In 1977 he was imprisoned after his most controversial work, Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want), produced in Nairobi, sharply criticized the injustices of Kenyan society and unequivocally championed the causes of ordinary citizens. Following his release, Ngugi decided to write only in his native Gikuyu, communicating with Kenyans in one of the many languages of their daily lives, and today he is known as one of the most outspoken intellectuals working in postcolonial theory and the global postcolonial movement. In this volume, Ngugi wa ThiongÕo summarizes and develops a cross-section of the issues he has grappled with in his work, which deploys a strategy of imagery, language, folklore, and character to ""decolonize the mind."" Ngugi confronts the politics of language in African writing; the problem of linguistic imperialism and literature's ability to resist it; the difficult balance between orality, or ""orature,"" and writing, or ""literature""; the tension between national and world literature; and the role of the literary curriculum in both reaffirming and undermining the dominance of the Western canon. Throughout, he engages a range of philosophers and theorists writing on power and postcolonial creativity, including Hegel, Marx, Lvi-Strauss, and Aim Csaire.

Abdalla became famous in 1973, with the publication of Sauti ya Dhiki (Voice of Agony), a collection of poems written secretly in prison during three years of solitary confinement (1969-72). He was convicted of circulating pamphlets against Jomo Kenyattas KANU government, criticizing it as dictatorial and calling for political resistance in the pamphlet, 'Kenya: Twendapi?' (Kenya: where are we heading?). His poetry epitomizes the ongoing currency of classic Swahili form and language, while his work overall, including translations and editorships, exemplifies a two-way mediation between traditional and modern perspectives. It makes old and new voices of Swahili poetry and African literature accessible to a wider readership in East Africa, and beyond. Abdalla has lived in exile since 1973, in Tanzania, London, and subsequently, until now, in Germany. Nevertheless, Swahili literature and Kenyan politics have remained central to his life.",,a statement given by abdilatif abdalla chief co ordinator of the united movement for democracy in kenya to the 7th pan african congress kampala uganda on 3 8 april 1994 | abdilatif abdalla,,a statement given by abdilatif abdalla chief co ordinator of the united movement for democracy in kenya to the 7th pan african congress kampala uganda on 3 8 april 1994,abdilatif abdalla,,,"A statement given by Abdilatif Abdalla, chief co-ordinator of the United Movement for Democracy in Kenya, to the 7th Pan-African Congress, Kampala, Uganda on 3-8 April, 1994

In this historically established Muslim environment, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, philosophy is investigated as social discourse and intellectual practice, situated in everyday life. This is done from the perspective of an 'anthropology of philosophy', a project which is spelled out in the opening chapter. Entry-points and guidelines for the ethnography are provided by discussions of Swahili literary genres, life histories, and social debates. From here, local discourses of knowledge are described and analysed. The social environment and discursive dynamics of the Old Town are portrayed, firstly, by means of following and contextualising informal discussions among neighbours and friends at daily meeting points in the streets; and secondly, by presenting and discussing in-depth case studies of local intellectuals and their contributions to moral and intellectual debates within the community. Taking recurrent internal discussions on social affairs, politics, and appropriate Islamic conduct as a focus, this study sheds light on local practices of critique and reflection. In particular, three local intellectuals (two poets, one Islamic scholar) are portrayed against the background of regional intellectual history, Islamic scholarship, as well as common public debates and private discussions. The three contextual portrayals discuss exemplary issues for the wider field of research on philosophical discourse in Mombasa and the Swahili context on the whole, with reference to the lives and projects of distinct individual thinkers. Ultimately, the study directs attention beyond the regional and the African contexts, towards the anthropological study of knowledge and intellectual practice around the world.",,umbuji wa kiwandeo | ahmed sheikh nabhany,,umbuji wa kiwandeo,ahmed sheikh nabhany,,,"Umbuji wa kiwandeo

The power of Babel,Ali AlʼAmin Mazrui,,,,,,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3787719-L.jpg,ol_author,"Linguists estimate that there are currently nearly 2,000 languages in Africa, a staggering figure that is belied by the relatively few national languages. While African national politics, economics, and law are all conducted primarily in the colonial languages, the cultural life of the majority of citizens is conducted in a bewildering Babel of local and regional dialects, making language itself the center of debates over multiculturalism, gender studies, and social theory. In The Power of Babel, the noted Africanist scholar Ali Mazrui and linguist Alamin Mazrui explore this vast territory of African language. The Power of Babel is one of the first comprehensive studies of the complex linguistic constellations of Africa. It draws on Ali Mazrui's earlier work in its examination of the ""triple heritage"" of African culture, in which indigenous, Islamic, and Western traditions compete for influence. In bringing the idea of the triple heritage to language, the Mazruis unravel issues of power, culture, and modernity as they are embedded in African linguistic life. The first section of the book takes a global perspective, exploring such issues as the Eurocentrism of much linguistic scholarship on Africa; part two takes an African perspective on a variety of issues from the linguistically disadvantaged position of women in Africa to the relation of language policy and democratic development; the third section presents a set of regional studies, centering on the Swahili language's exemplification of the triple heritage.The Power of Babel unites empirical information with theories of nationalism and pluralism—among others—to offer the richest contextual account of African languages to date.",,the power of babel | ali al amin mazrui,3787719.0,the power of babel,ali al amin mazrui,,,"The power of Babel

He also shows how these terms may be crafted to new artistic and social practices, particularly in what it means to decolonize the places of display and learning.

The book provides the first sustained account of artwriting in the British context over the full extent of its development and includes new analyses of such central figures as Hogarth, Reynolds, Gilpin, Ruskin, Roger Fry, Herbert Read, Art & Language, Peter Fuller and Rasheed Araeen. Mark A. Cheetham also explores how the 'Englishing' of art theory-which came about despite the longstanding occlusion of the intellectual and theoretical in British culture-did not take place or have effects exclusively in Britain. Theory has always travelled with art and vice versa. Using the frequently resurgent discourse of cosmopolitanism as a frame for his discourse, Cheetham asks whether English traditions of artwriting have been judged inappropriately according to imported criteria of what theory is and does. This book demonstrates that artwriting in the English tradition has not been sufficiently studied, and that 'English Art Theory' is not an oxymoron. Such concerns resonate today beyond academe and the art world in the many heated discussions of resurgent Englishness.",,looking both ways | laurie ann farrell,5400206.0,looking both ways,laurie ann farrell,,,"Looking both ways

This book makes fascinating what might seem at first glance complex. It describes diverse approaches that have been adjusted to local circumstances across the continent and reflects on the push to unite and harmonise toward African union. Africa is rich, yet resources are lost through loopholes in fiscal systems. Financial resources come from the people, are not unlimited, and do not come easily or without cost. Africans must therefore cherish these resources and use them in nation-building and national and regional development. Efficient, effective, transparent and accountable fiscal systems that are fair and just will go a long way toward financing Africas development. Using examples from all of Africas 54 countries, the book makes fiscal matters real and understandable for people, no matter their field.

This book makes fascinating what might seem at first glance complex. It describes diverse approaches that have been adjusted to local circumstances across the continent and reflects on the push to unite and harmonise toward African union. Africa is rich, yet resources are lost through loopholes in fiscal systems. Financial resources come from the people, are not unlimited, and do not come easily or without cost. Africans must therefore cherish these resources and use them in nation-building and national and regional development. Efficient, effective, transparent and accountable fiscal systems that are fair and just will go a long way toward financing Africas development. Using examples from all of Africas 54 countries, the book makes fiscal matters real and understandable for people, no matter their field. It demonstrates the importance of fiscal law and policy for development and the impact it has on individuals, communities, nations, regional groupings, and the continent.",,financing africa | attiya waris,,financing africa,attiya waris,,,"Financing Africa

The modern developing state can be said to be facing a crisis of fiscal legitimacy, afflicted by poor governance, poor societal participation, corruption and a lack of accountability. This book investigates whether a possible remedy in averting the fiscal crisis is firstly, to re-establish a link between taxation and government expenditure in the developing state and to utilise human rights law, principles and policies to link tax revenue to expenditure through re-distribution. This thesis will consider whether human rights may be the tool or vehicle for citizens to assess fiscal allocations It analyses developing countries with reference to Brazil and India and more specifically Kenya.",,taxation and state building in kenya | attiya waris,,taxation and state building in kenya,attiya waris,,,"Taxation and state building in Kenya

The evident abuse of tax systems by corporations and rich individuals through tax avoidance schemes and offshore shadow banking is increasingly in the public eye. Above all, the political challenges of recovery and structural reform have raised core issues of burden-sharing and social equity on the agendas of both civil society groups and political elites. Democratic states need tax revenue to fund public goods and combat public “bads” with any degree of legitimacy. The contributions to this book discuss the haphazard evolution of contemporary taxation systems, their contradictory effects in a globalized economy, and the urgency of their reform as a precondition for social justice.",,tax justice and the political economy of global capitalism 1945 to the present | jeremy leaman,,tax justice and the political economy of global capitalism 1945 to the present,jeremy leaman,,,"Tax Justice and the Political Economy of Global Capitalism, 1945 to the Present

Das Leben kommt immer dazwischen,Auma Obama,,,,,,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12770998-L.jpg,ol_author,"Barack Obama Sr., father of the American president, was part of Africa's ""independence generation"" and in 1959 it seemed his star would shine brightly. He came to the U.S. from Kenya and was given a university scholarship. While in the Hawaii, he met Ann Dunham in 1961, and his son Barack was born. He left his young family to gain a master's degree from Harvard. After that, Obama's life became progressively more complicated. He was a brilliant economist, yet never held the coveted government job he felt should have been his. He was a polygamist, an alcoholic, and an ardent African nationalist unafraid to tell truth to power at a time when that could get you killed. Father of eight, nurturer of none, he was an unlikely person to father the first African American president of the United States. Yet he was, like that son, a man moved by the dream of a better world. Now, thanks to dozens of exclusive new interviews, prodigious research, and determined investigation, Sally Jacobs tells his full story.",,das leben kommt immer dazwischen | auma obama,12770998.0,das leben kommt immer dazwischen,auma obama,,,"Das Leben kommt immer dazwischen

The Germans are led by Arminius, a chieftain who is a trusted ally of Rome - and a man who has been secretly planning to betray the empire since childhood. Trapping Varus' legionaries between a hillside and a marsh, and thereby preventing them from forming up or using their artillery, Arminius and his warriors wreak a terrible slaughter. The Roman defeat is overwhelming, but it is not until the third day of the massacre that the scale of Arminius' victory becomes clear. Three legions, upwards of fourteen thousand men have been annihilated, and three treasured Eagle standards have been lost. Just a few hundred legionaries, including Tullus, manage to escape.

Die Berichte über die Greueltaten der War Lords und ihrer Milizen gingen um die Welt. Andreas Herzau hat den Bürgerkrieg und die Flüchtlingsbewegungen damals vor Ort als Reporter erlebt und dokumentiert. Als in den Jahren 2005/06 ein erstaunlicher Aufarbeitungs- und Demokratisierungsprozess in Liberia einsetzte, besuchte er das Land erneut, stellte bald aber fest, dass diese Geschehnisse in der westlichen Welt auf weit weniger Interesse stießen als die 'Sensationen des Negativen'.0Ihm wurde deutlich, wie sehr das europäische Bild von Afrika durch den Fokus auf Kriege und Krisen geprägt ist. Sobald sich die Situation in einem der Länder zum Guten wendet, berichtet niemand mehr darüber. Bestand haben einzig die Bilder und Nachrichten von Greueltaten, Chaos, Hunger und Opfern. Herzau bemerkte, dass diese 'déformation professionelle' auch seinen Blick bestimmte. Er beschloss daraufhin, ein Experiment zu wagen und das Land 2019 unter anderen Vorzeichen zu betrachten. Das Ziel war, in Erfahrung zu bringen, ob es ihm gelinge, Liberia mit einem Interesse am Positiven zu bereisen und eine optische Sprache dafür zu finden. Das vorliegenden Buch stellt im Wortsinn einen Versuch dar, sich der zementierenden Wirkung einseitiger Opferberichterstattung entgegenzustellen und dem Stereotyp des europäischen Afrikabildes zu entkommen. Inspiration dafür war auch der Essay 'How to write about Africa' des kenianischen Autors Binyavanga Wainaina, der dem Band in Deutsch und Englisch vorangestellt ist.",,andreas herzau | andreas herzau,,andreas herzau,andreas herzau,,,"Andreas Herzau

We the women-- for peace,Aseghedech Ghirmazion,,,,,,,,ol_author,"A study of the women who led the United States section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in the interwar years, this book argues that the ideas of these women--the importance of nurturing, nonviolence, feminism, and a careful balancing of people's differences with their common humanity--constitute an important addition to our understanding of the intellectual heritage of the United States. Most of these women were well educated and prominent in their chosen fields: they included Jane Addams and Emily Greene Balch, the only two United States women to win Nobel Prizes for Peace; Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to the U.S. Congress; and Dorothy Detzer, the woman who prompted the investigation of the munitions industry in the 1930's. The ideas of these women were not usually expressed in forms conventionally studied by intellectual historians. On the whole, their ideas must be teased out of organizational records, statements of principle and policy, and personal correspondence. When combined with an understanding of the personal backgrounds of the WIL leaders and placed in the context of early-twentieth-century America, these documents tell us what these women thought was important and why. The ideas of the WIL leaders are also analyzed in the context of the intellectual themes of Victorianism and modernism. Our understanding of these themes has been based largely on the work of privileged European and American men, and the ideas of women often fit uncomfortably into these traditional categories. A reconstruction of the ideas of the WIL leaders suggests that historians have overlooked an important, alternative intellectual tradition in the United States. To understand and appreciate women's thoughts, we must dissolve the old constructs and let new, multifaceted ones replace them.",,we the women for peace | aseghedech ghirmazion,,we the women for peace,aseghedech ghirmazion,,,"We the women-- for peace

Grieved greatly by his imperfections, she still believed in the ultimate perfectibility of man. Few of the great Victorians brought about by their personal efforts more of the material improvements of the era than Florence Nightingale. Probably in her own mind the betterment of the soldiers' lot, in sickness and in health, that she had helped to bring about would have rated highest. Next to that would have come her efforts to better the health of the peasants of India. Today she is remembered first and foremost as the founder of the nursing profession in its modern form. Her 38 ragtag-and-bobtail women, who coped with the shambles at Scutari, and the 15 young ladies introduced into St. Thomas' in 1860, were the start of one of the greatest of all services to mankind.

Kamasai. At the foot of the mountain ran the Cheboiywa River, the boundary between the Nandi and Luyia. On the other side of the mountain, from Kapkeimur onwards, were European settlers and priests. But on the slopes of the mountain, in densest forest, the people of Kamasai lived completely cut off. The houses were built among the boulders. There were no grassy plains for cattle to graze on. The little grass they could obtain was found in gaps in the forest canopy where the trees allowed the sunlight to filter down. The produce of the women's vegetable gardens had to be shared with the monkeys that came from the forest around them.

Instead, these traditions stretch far into such neighboring countries as Somalia and Ethiopia. Simon Gikandi and Evan Mwangi assemble a truly inclusive list of major writers and trends. They begin with a chronology of key historical events and an overview of the emergence and transformation of literary culture in the region. Then they provide an alphabetical list of major writers and brief descriptions of their concerns and achievements. Some of the writers discussed include the Kenyan novelists Grace Ogot and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Ugandan poet and essayist Taban Lo Liyong, Ethiopian playwright and poet Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, Tanzanian novelist and diplomat Peter Palangyo, Ethiopian novelist Berhane Mariam Sahle-Sellassie, and the novelist M. G. Vassanji, who portrays the Indian diaspora in Africa, Europe, and North America. Separate entries within this list describe thematic concerns, such as colonialism, decolonization, the black aesthetic, and the language question; the growth of genres like autobiography and popular literature; important movements like cultural nationalism and feminism; and the impact of major forces such as AIDS/HIV, Christian missions, and urbanization. Comprehensive and richly detailed, this guide offers a fresh perspective on the role of East Africa in the development of African and world literature in English and a new understanding of the historical, cultural, and geopolitical boundaries of the region.",,juices | jared angira,,juices,jared angira,,,"Juices

This story starts with her childhood in the 20s and 30s on a Kenyan coffee farm. Brought up by her father's black servants and white governesses, much of her time was spent riding and with the tame wild animals. This was the White Mischief era, when parents were busy partying and children lived their own hidden lives. But there was school to attend in Europe and later South Africa, a different establishment each year, where she struggled to speak English instead of Swahili. There was finishing school in Switzerland, and even in Kenya the less innocent adult life began to encroach on her African idyll. At fifteen she became involved in the Lord Erroll affair and is the only person to whom Delves Broughton confessed to the murder of Lord Erroll.",,child of happy valley | juanita carberry,,child of happy valley,juanita carberry,,,"Child of happy valley

It reconceives sexual representation from the point of view of the theoretical, political and empirical trajectories of decolonization, provincialization and neoliberalism to look at the role of historical contingency, postcolonial sexual politics and gender and sexual diversity. The volume brings together anthropological, historical, material and political analyses around South Asian sexual politics by exploring a range of themes, including culture, class, ethnicity, identity, intersectionality, migration, borders, diaspora, modernity and cosmopolitanism across various local, regional and global contexts. By using southern/non-Western and subaltern theorizations of gender and sexuality, the book discusses South Asian sexualities through issues such as the sexual politics of indeterminacy; sexual subculture, iconography and political decision-making; religious identity; queer South Asian diaspora; decolonizing the postcolonial body; sexual politics, gender and feminist debates; discrimination, and socio-political violence; the political economy of empowerment; and critical appropriation of the 377 Indian Penal Code. It also builds forms of dialogues to bridge the gap between academic and development practitioners. With diverse case studies and a fresh theoretical framework, this book will be an essential read for scholars and researchers of South Asian studies, gender studies, sexuality studies, sociology and social anthropology, political studies, diaspora studies, postcolonial and global south studies.",,boldly queer | theo sandfort,,boldly queer,theo sandfort,,,"Boldly queer

How have African writers engaged urgent questions regarding race, nation, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality? And how do African literary genres interrelate with traditional oral forms or audio-visual and digital media? A Companion to African Literatures addresses these issues and many more. Consisting of essays by distinguished scholars and emerging leaders in the field, this book offers rigorous, deeply engaging discussions of African literatures on the continent and in diaspora. It covers the four main geographical regions (East and Central Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa), presenting ample material to learn from and think with. A Companion To African Literatures is divided into five parts. The first four cover different regions of the continent, while the fifth part considers conceptual issues and newer directions of inquiry. Chapters focus on literatures in European languages officially used in Africa -- English, French, and Portuguese -- as well as homegrown African languages: Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic, Swahili, and Yoruba. With its lineup of lucid and authoritative analyses, readers will find in A Companion to African Literatures a distinctive, rewarding academic resource. Perfect for undergraduate and graduate students in literary studies programs with an African focus, A Companion to African Literatures will also earn a place in the libraries of teachers, researchers, and professors who wish to strengthen their background in the study of African literatures.",,a game of cards | kithaka wa mberia,,a game of cards,kithaka wa mberia,,,"A game of cards

With determination born of suffering, Koigi wa Wamwere documents the brutality of the colonial years. He describes the physical and emotional abuse visited on his parents and others by the plundering British.

Tracing the roots of the Mau Mau rebellion and the strict curfews and violence of the colonial government, wa Wamwere follows the evolution and degeneration of Jomo Kenyatta and the rise of Daniel arap Moi. During those years, wa Wamwere began to speak out and fight for human rights. In 1979 he won a seat in the parliament, where he represented the economically depressed Nakuru district for three years. His history is infused with freedom songs of his people and revealing allegories born out of the Kenyan storytelling tradition.

As an activist, a journalist, and a member of the Kenyan parliament, wa Wamwere was framed and detained on three separate instances, spending thirteen years in prison, where he was tortured but not broken. His mother and other mothers led a hunger strike to free him and fellow political prisoners. Their efforts brought about a show trial where wa Wamwere was sentenced to four more years in prison and six strokes of the cane. Under such a sentence, others had died from abuse to body and spirit. But, buoyed by a growing chorus of international support, wa Wamwere refused his fate.

Negative Ethnicity,Koigi Wa Wamwere,,,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8duB0b-C1WAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,ol_author,"""Negative ethnicity"" is Koigi wa Wamwere’s name for the deep-seated tensions in Africa that the world has seen flare so terrifyingly. The genocide in Rwanda and ""ethnic"" killing in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and elsewhere stand out as examples. Wa Wamwere argues that these clashes cannot properly be described as ethnically motivated; ethnicity, a positive distinction, has nothing of the hatred here at work. Negative Ethnicity gives a new picture of the force behind untold deaths on the continent, dispelling the myth of an intractable conflict waged along simple, ancient lines. Negative Ethnicity explains the roots, colonial and pre-colonial, of the current ""ethnic"" tensions. It goes on to describe how, for most Africans, ethnic identity is ambiguous, and analyzes why that fact is obscured. The culprits are many: chronic poverty, a broken education system, preying dictators, corrupt officials, the colonial legacy of hate, the ongoing exploitation of the West. Negative Ethnicity is both a history and a manual for change, intended to introduce Westerners to the crisis and to give Africans a new understanding of it. Perhaps never before has the problem been addressed with such clarity and insight.",,negative ethnicity | koigi wa wamwere,,negative ethnicity,koigi wa wamwere,,,"Negative Ethnicity

The book is infused with the freedom songs of the Kenyan people, as well as dream prophecy and folk tales that are part of Kenya's rich storytelling tradition. Tracing the roots of the Mau Mau rebellion, wa Wamwere follows the evolution and degeneration of Jomo Kenyatta and the rise of Daniel arap Moi. In 1979, wa Wamwere won a seat in the parliament, where he represented the economically depressed Nakuru district for three years. An outspoken activist and journalist, wa Wamwere was framed and detained on three separate instances, spending thirteen years in prison, where he was tortured but not broken. His mother and others led a hunger strike to free him and fellow political prisoners. Their efforts brought about a show trial at which Koigi was sentenced to four more years in prison and ""six strokes of the cane,"" and escaped Kenya—and probably execution—only through the exertions of human rights groups and the government of Norway.",,kenya | koigi wa wamwere,,kenya,koigi wa wamwere,,,"Kenya

Amongst us are women battling with fears, insecurities, ailments, shame and all manner of misfortunes but just like these eight women, God's grace has been made available and their testimonies can as well be replicated in the life of Jackie, Stella, Amanda or the girl next door.

Natasha ministers encouragement and hope to every woman and man who is caught up in the web of lies that satan often throws around with the intention of robbing God's children of their Kingdom identity and destiny.

He can use anyone who is obedi-ent and fully surrendered to walk in the pathways of His perfect will.

The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction 2021,Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki,,,,,,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14845594-L.jpg,ol_author,"The Year's Best African Speculative Fiction (2021), edited by the award-winning Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, is not just a book; it's a gateway to the diverse and rich world of African speculative fiction. This anthology, a winner of the Best Anthology at the World Fantasy Awards, is a groundbreaking collection that brings together twenty-nine extraordinary stories by twenty-five talented writers from Africa and its diaspora. These stories represent some of the most exciting voices in the genre, both old and new, offering readers a journey through imaginative landscapes filled with wonder, insight, and a deep understanding of the human and beyond-human experience. 

The anthology is a celebration of African speculative fiction, marking a significant moment in the genre. It is the first of its kind, highlighting the breadth and depth of talent that exists within the African speculative fiction community. The collection includes tales from a range of authors, including Somto O. Ihezue, Pemi Aguda, Russell Nichols, Tamara Jerée, Tlotlo Tsamaase, and many others, each contributing their unique voice and vision. The stories navigate themes of identity, culture, and the complexities of the human spirit in ways that are both universal and deeply rooted in African experiences. 

Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, the editor, is not only a skilled anthologist but also a celebrated author in his own right. His work has received multiple accolades, including the Nommoaward and recognition as aNebula and Hugo award finalist. In editing this anthology, Ekpeki has opened a door to a realm of stories that challenge, entertain, and provoke thought, offering a vital platform for voices that are often underrepresented in the global speculative fiction landscape. 

This anthology is more than just a collection of stories; it is a testament to the power of speculative fiction to transcend boundaries and explore new horizons. It is highly recommended for anyone looking to delve into a world where the speculative meets the vibrantly diverse tapestry of African storytelling. Whether you're a long-time fan of speculative fiction or new to the genre, The Year's Best African Speculative Fiction (2021) is bound to leave you wonderstruck and eager for more.",,the year s best african speculative fiction 2021 | oghenechovwe donald ekpeki,14845594.0,the year s best african speculative fiction 2021,oghenechovwe donald ekpeki,,,"The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction 2021

The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction 2023,Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki,,,,,,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14845593-L.jpg,ol_author,"This is the third volume in this highly praised series (the first won the World Fantasy Award). Previous works have been praised for their eclectic mix of stories, offering a panorama of themes and styles. For instance, the 2021 edition included a story about a woman struggling with her identity and relationship in the face of a thought-recording device, a tale of a man fostering a rapidly evolving robot, and an adventurous narrative about a sentient robot dog engaging in space piracy. These stories not only explored advanced technologies and speculative scenarios but also delved deep into human emotions, relationships, and societal issues.

Themes of personal struggles, such as dealing with depression, anxiety, and feelings of alienation, were also prominent. These were manifested through unique and powerful metaphors, like a woman whose detachable body parts symbolized her sense of disintegration and invisibility, or a story that portrayed the torment of self-contempt through the constant barrage of negative thoughts from imaginary entities.

The anthology also ventured into mythic dimensions, echoing the voices and histories of entire cultures through concise yet profound storytelling. For example, flash fiction pieces in the collection reached the heights of epic poetry, encapsulating the journey of human life and cultural evolution.

With such a backdrop, the 2023 volume continues this tradition of blending speculative elements with profound human experiences and cultural narratives. It's likely to feature stories that push the boundaries of imagination while staying grounded in the complexities of the human condition. Readers can anticipate a collection that entertains, provokes thought, and offers new perspectives on the future and the present. The anthology is not just a showcase of speculative fiction; it's a celebration of African storytelling, creativity, and the endless possibilities within the realm of speculative fiction.",,the year s best african speculative fiction 2023 | oghenechovwe donald ekpeki,14845593.0,the year s best african speculative fiction 2023,oghenechovwe donald ekpeki,,,"The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction 2023

At the age of sixteen, Paulina leaves her small village in western Kenya to join her new husband, Martin, in the bustling city of Nairobi. It is 1956, and Kenya is in the final days of the ""Emergency,"" as the British seek to suppress violent anti-colonial revolts. But Paulina knows little about, about city life, or about marriage, and Martin’s clumsy attempts to control her soon lead to a relationship filled with silences, misunderstandings, and unfulfilled expectations. Soon Paulina’s inability to bear a child effectively banishes her from the confines of traditional women’s roles. As her country at last moves toward independence, Paulina manages to achieve a kind of independence as well: She accepts a job that will require her to live separately from her husband, and she has an affair that leads to the birth of her first child. But Paulina’s hard-won contentment will be shattered when Kenya’s turbulent history intrudes into her private life, bringing with it tragedy—and a new test of her quiet courage and determination. Paulina’s patient struggles for survival and identity are revealed through Marjorie Macgoye’s keen and sensitive vision—a vision which extends to embrace the whole of a nation and a people likewise struggling to find their way. As the Weekly Standard of Kenya notes, ""Coming to Birth is a radical novel in firmly asserting our common humanity.""",,chira | marjorie oludhe macgoye,3725905.0,chira,marjorie oludhe macgoye,,,"Chira

Using logbooks, newspapers, and numerous other sources, this book pieces together the multifaceted and largely unknown history of the Tamar . From her launch into service to her roles as a hospital, theatre stage, and transport for military personnel, the Tamar carried not just people, but also their mundane dreams and ambitions— for friends, families, and staying alive. Any ideas or concerns about sustaining the empire seldom featured in their minds at all, but it was this empire that the Tamar served for seventy-nine years, steaming the equivalent of thirty-two times around the Earth and transporting tens of thousands of people to what would seem to them another world. In this engaging narrative, the Tamar’s exploits and the experiences of her crew and passengers parallel those of the British Empire and its subjects, bringing to life the realities of imperial life on land and at sea. As mud continues to settle over the Tamar’s forgotten remains in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour, Transport to Another World will appeal to historians and readers interested in maritime history and colonial Hong Kong in general, and makes a case for conserving the memory of a past some would prefer to forget.",,campaign and be damned | marjorie wallace,,campaign and be damned,marjorie wallace,,,"Campaign and be damned

In My Paper Chase, Harold Evans recounts the wild and wonderful tale of newspapering life. His story stretches from the 1930s to his service in WWII, through towns big and off the map. He discusses his passion for the crusading style of reportage he championed, his clashes with Rupert Murdoch, and his struggle to use journalism to better the lives of those less fortunate. There's a star-studded cast and a tremendously vivid sense of what once was: the lead type, the smell of the presses, eccentrics throughout, and angry editors screaming over the intercoms. My Paper Chase tells the story of Evans's great loves: newspapers and Tina Brown, the bright, young journalist who became his wife. In an age when newspapers everywhere are under threat, My Paper Chase is not just a glorious recounting of an amazing life, but a nostalgic journey in black and white.",,on giant s shoulders | marjorie wallace,,on giant s shoulders,marjorie wallace,,,"On giant's shoulders

Indeed, Whitaker argues, modern treatments for the severely mentally ill are just old medicine in new bottles and we as a society are deluded about their efficacy. Tracing over three centuries of ""cures"" for madness, Whitaker shows how medical therapies-from ""spinning"" or ""chilling"" patients in colonial times to more modern methods of electroshock, lobotomy, and drugs-have been used to silence patients and dull their minds, deepening their suffering and impairing their hope of recovery. Based on exhaustive research culled from old patient medical records, historical accounts, and government documents, this haunting book raises important questions about our obligations to the mad, what it means to be ""insane,"" and what we value most about the human mind.",,schizophrenia 1992 | marjorie wallace,,schizophrenia 1992,marjorie wallace,,,"Schizophrenia 1992

Knockemstiff is a genuine entry into the literature of place. Spanning a period from the mid-sixties to the late nineties, the linked stories that comprise Knockemstiff feature a cast of recurring characters who are irresistibly, undeniably real. A father pumps his son full of steroids so he can vicariously relive his days as a perpetual runner-up body builder. A psychotic rural recluse comes upon two siblings committing incest and feels compelled to take action. Donald Ray Pollock presents his characters and the sordid goings-on with a stern intelligence, a bracing absence of value judgments, and a refreshingly dark sense of bottom-dog humor.",,work | donald ray pollock,7795237.0,work,donald ray pollock,,,"Work

The book historicizes NGOs using the Rockefeller Foundation as a case study, looking at its tripartite paradoxical roles as an agent of colonialism, globalization and development/underdevelopment. It deploys interdisciplinary devices to show how the RF projects have engaged in marginalization, patronage and ‘othering’ of African values and customs and the ensuing controversies. Using globalization, postmodern and postcolonial theories the book deconstructs the long-held myths about NGO inviolability, and opens ground for understanding their strengths. It interrogates sites of contestation, apprehension and possibilities that the RF has produced. Using RF projects, it looks at structures of hegemony, race, power, class and gender that the RF has created. The book illustrates the extent to which the RF has been instrumental in spreading capitalism, imperialism in economic, political, cultural and social realms through globalization. It desists from the grand narrative approach that has dominated African history in the past but instead gives agency and voice to those that have previously been marginalized.",,the ngo factor in africa | maurice amutabi,1224084.0,the ngo factor in africa,maurice amutabi,,,"The NGO Factor in Africa

But there has been little public space for dialogue about the complex relationship between feminism, women, and war. The editors of Feminism and War have brought together a diverse set of leading theorists and activists who examine the questions raised by ongoing American military initiatives, such as: What are the implications of an imperial nation/state laying claim to women's liberation? What is the relation between this claim and resulting American foreign policy and military action? Did American intervention and invasion in fact result in liberation for women in Afghanistan and Iraq? What multiple concepts are embedded in the phrase ""women’s liberation""? How are these connected to the specifics of religion, culture, history, economics, and nation within current conflicts? What is the relation between the lives of Afghan and Iraqi women before and after invasion, and that of women living in the US? How do women who define themselves as feminists resist or acquiesce to this nation/state claim in current theory and organizing? Feminism and War reveals and critically analyzes the complicated ways in which America uses gender, race, class, nationalism, imperialism to justify, legitimate, and continue war. Each chapter builds on the next to develop an anti-racist, feminist politics that places imperialist power, and forms of resistance to it, central to its comprehensive analysis.",,feminism and war | judy rohrer,,feminism and war,judy rohrer,,,"Feminism and War

Matatu is animated by a lively interest in African culture and literature (including the Afro-Caribbean) that moves beyond worn-out clichés of ""cultural authenticity"" and ""national liberation"" towards critical exploration of African modernities. The East African public transport vehicle from which Matatu takes its name is both a component and a symbol of these modernities: based on ""Western"" (these days usually Japanese) technology, it is a vigorously African institution; it is usually regarded with some anxiety by those travelling in it, but is often enough the only means of transport available; it creates temporary communicative communities and provides a transient site for the exchange of news, storytelling, and political debate. Matatu is firmly committed to supporting democratic change in Africa, to providing a forum for interchanges between African and European critical debates, to overcoming notions of absolute cultural, ethnic, or religious alterity, and to promoting transnational discussion on the future of African societies in a wider world. Matatu will be published as journal as of 2016.

""Out of the Desert"": Undercover Deputy U.S. Marshal Dan Boone correctly suspects a banker's plot to steal a gold shipment... ""The Hero of Lost Creek"": A crippled horse breaker turns hero when he foils cattle rustlers and wins the heart of the boss's daughter. ""The Trail to Nowhere"": With Indians hot on his heels, a naked trapper and former schoolteacher runs into the forest in the dead of winter and uses little more than ingenuity to thwart his enemies and get all his stuff back. ""Quickdraw"": Using a special arm harness and pieces of an old corset, Walker shoots it out with the town bully... ""Square-Toed Boots"": In a cow town, his farmer's boots appear to make him fair game but, when four cowboys dare to insult his wife, they're about to get a lesson in good manners. ""Come Morning"": At twelve, Sean Mixus can handle a Sharps .50 rifle like nobody's business but putting up with a bath at his sister's house every day forces him to consider O'Reilly and the trail herd as his best escape. ""Gold is Where You Find It"": Marcus and Saul swindle a greedy banker into buying a worthless gold mine, leave town, and they're living in what they believe is the lap of luxury when they read about a gold strike--right where their false map sent the banker! ""Mad Dog Muncie"": Two scoundrels at Fort Clark have been cheating folks and selling boys into slavery...but then Mad Dog Muncie appears to right a few wrongs.

Using a postcolonial analytical framework, the book highlights the commonalities of African women’s identities and experiences across national, ethnic, linguistic, and religious boundaries in Africa and in western settings. It collates the multi-regional narratives of key African women writers who convey how women’s lives are shaped by social, economic, and political factors at home and abroad. It also illustrates the intersection of ethnicity, class, and gender that flows through all the texts examined. Unlike existing works that explore African women’s fiction, this book uncovers the transformation from postcolonial themes of nationhood to global modalities of post-independence writing through the lens of gender. The book engages with feminist expression through broad themes including religion, war and ethnic conflict, women’s status in society, tradition and modernity and local and global tensions. A unique approach to literary criticism of Anglophone African women’s writing, this book will be of interest to scholars and students in the field of African Literature, African Studies, Women’s Literature, Postcolonial Literature, Cultural and Ethnic Studies and Migration and Diaspora Studies.",,passbook number f 47927 | muthoni likimani,5370602.0,passbook number f 47927,muthoni likimani,,,"Passbook number F.47927

One of these exiles, a young man named Kalumba, is a graduate student in the United States, where he encounters Mrs. Shaw, a professor emerita and former British settler who fled Kwatee’s postcolonial political and social turmoil. Kalumba’s girlfriend, too, is an exile: a Puerto Rican nationalist like her imprisoned father, she is an outcast from the island. Brought together by a history of violence and betrayals, all three are seeking a way of regaining their humanity, connecting with each other, and learning to make a life in a new land. Kalumba and Mrs. Shaw, in particular, are linked by a past rooted in colonial and postcolonial violence, yet they are separated by their differing accounts of what really happened. The memory of each is subject to certain lapses, whether selective or genuine. Even when they agree on the facts—be they acts of love, of betrayal, or of violence—each narrator shapes the story in his or her own way, by what is left in and what is left out, by what is remembered and what is forgotten.",,mrs shaw | mukoma wa ngugi,,mrs shaw,mukoma wa ngugi,,,"Mrs. Shaw

Haunted by the memories of the carnage and mass incarceration carried out by the British colonial-settler state in his native Kenya but inspired by the titanic struggle against it, Ngũgĩ, then known as James Ngugi, begins to weave stories from the fibers of memory, history, and a shockingly vibrant and turbulent present. What unfolds in this moving and thought-provoking memoir is simultaneously the birth of a literary giant—lauded for his “epic imagination” (Los Angeles Times)—the death of one of the most violent episodes in global history, and the emergence of new histories and nations with uncertain futures.",,voices from my clan | mukoma wa ngugi,,voices from my clan,mukoma wa ngugi,,,"Voices from my clan

From the hidden truth of fast action, mutual aid and transnational cooperation in poorer countries to the widespread falsehoods of Western commentary, Nyabola exposes a global society scarred by colonial legacies, lazy narratives and ingrained biases. These essays are an inventory of the staggering political and social failures of our time, and the myths exposed in Covid’s wake. Watching coronavirus spread in Kenya and around the world, Nyabola reflects on a long history of onlookers denying the Global South’s agency and successes in times of emergency.

Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics aims to change this by presenting a unique contribution to the debate on digital democracy. For traditionally marginalized groups, particularly women and the disabled, digital spaces have provided vital platforms that allow Kenyans to build new communities that transcend old ethnic and gender divisions. Covering attempts by political elites to prevent social movements from translating online visibility into meaningful offline gains, Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics explores the drastic efforts to contain online activism and new methods of feminist mobilization, as well as how ""fake news,"" Cambridge Analytica, and allegations of hacking contributed to tensions around the 2017 elections.

The man who would become one of Africa's leading writers was the fifth child of the third wife. Even as World War II affected the lives of Africans under British colonial rule in particularly unexpected ways, Ngugi spent his childhood as very much the apple of his mother's eye before attending school to slake what was then considered a bizarre thirst for learning.In Dreams in a Time of War, Ngugi deftly etches a bygone era, capturing the landscape, the people, and their culture; the social and political vicissitudes of life under colonialism and war; and the troubled relationship between an emerging Christianized middle class and the rural poor. And he shows how the Mau Mau armed struggle for Kenya's independence against the British informed not only his own life but also the lives of those closest to him.Dreams in a Time of War speaks to the human right to dream even in the worst of times.

It is widely accepted that the elections were deeply flawed, and that there was electoral malfeasance by all the major players. President Kibaki's rapid declaration of victory in the face of a heavily disputed election and his determination to hold on to the levers of state power precipitated a deadly crisis, communal violence and economic decline. A power-sharing deal between Kibaki and Opposition leader, Raila Odinga signed in February seems to be holding, but Kenya ranks among the worlds’ growing number of democracies at-risk. This book takes a new look at the 2007 election, the post-election crisis, the underlying interaction of ethnicity, class and political power; forced displacement, the role of international forces; and the country’s power-sharing arrangement. The study will draw upon the expertise of a variety of leading experts on Kenya, and will be edited by Peter Kagwanja and Roger Southall. The overall project was based on a workshop in Nairobi on 6-7 December 2008.

Specifically, the paper examines Pretoria's involvement in Africa, and its internal capacity to support its mediation, peacekeeping and strengthening of the abilities of African institutions for peacemaking. Further, it examines the challenges posed by tension between its pan-African and economic interests as well as power rivalry at the continental level, which have greatly limited its ability to play a more assertive role in regional political and economic developments. Since its transition from apartheid to democracy in April 1994, South Africa has been an increasingly important player in peace promotion activities across the continent. Because of its moral power arising from its unique transition from apartheid to democracy, and its military and economic might, South Africa is widely viewed as being in the same league as other global middle-sized powers, and as a regional 'superpower'.",,an encumbered regional power? | peter kagwanja,,an encumbered regional power,peter kagwanja,,,"An encumbered regional power?

In this tell-all book, the author paints an insider's view of government, exposing the odds that are inexorably ranged against those who challenge the status quo and are perceived to be all-powerful. Hers is the intriguing story of a mistaken tag that at once opens multiple warfronts with shadowy detractors and opens previously unimaginable doors. The author provides a window into statecraft in a way that leaves the reader, researchers, ministers and even serving and aspiring public servants the richer.",,kiraitu murungi | peter kagwanja,,kiraitu murungi,peter kagwanja,,,"Kiraitu Murungi

The book addresses the colonial legacy of poverty creation, as well as the socio-political conditioning of Africans to dislike each other and to be irresponsible and disunited in the face of external threats. Poverty, hatred of other Africans, and excessive dependency on European powers can be traced to the policies adopted by colonial officials. Related to these issues, is post-colonial Kenya's attempts to addresses the political developments, the involvement of different types of media in those developments, Kenya's foreign policy, and the problem of political party transition. Ultimately, there are topical issues that continue to affect Kenya which include the question of coalition politics, the lessons of the 2002 elections, the media and corruption, parliament and foreign policy, and Africa's relations with the United States of America.",,eye on the nation | peter kagwanja,,eye on the nation,peter kagwanja,,,"Eye on the nation

It reveals how white privilege, misogyny and a culture of impunity at the UN create a toxic work environment that even impacts how UN projects and programs are implemented. The book debunks the myth that the United Nations is a club of equals committed to preventing wars and protecting the world's most vulnerable people.

UNsilenced shows that, in fact, the UN has remained a bystander in many of these conflicts and that peace-building efforts have not only been undermined by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, but also by the UNs many agencies and programmes. The book exposes how, under the guise of development, stability and the war on terror, the UN fails to prevent conflicts in many parts of the world, and in some cases, misleads the public about the scale of a problem. The book also reveals the web of lies, cover-ups, corruption and impunity within the United Nations that has allowed wrongdoing to continue unabated. Many of these acts of wrongdoing occur or continue because the UN fails to protect whistleblowers; on the contrary, most UN whistleblowers experience severe retaliation. UNsilenced describes how whistleblowers have been denied justice within the UN system and how the immunity accorded to UN officials and the conflict of interest inherent in the UNs internal justice system allow the perpetrators of criminal or unethical activities to go unpunished. The book is an urgent call for a serious reform of this bureaucratic, arcane and increasingly politicized organization because not doing so constitutes a betrayal of the trust invested in it by the people and countries that depend on it.",,unsilenced | rasna warah,14848269.0,unsilenced,rasna warah,,,"Unsilenced

All the contributors to this anthology approach the notion of development through their own worldviews and experiences: many are convinced that it is time to declare the death of development as an idea, as an ideology, and as an industry. The essays in this book come from various writers, most of whom are either based in East Africa, or are part of its diaspora, or who have worked, often as developmentalists in their own way, within Africa. Consequently, this extremely accessible collection does not attempt the grand sweep, raging aimlessly against the development machine with general complaints that fail to hit their mark. Rather, it is a focused peep into international, regional and local attempts to develop Africa, thereby exposing the reader to a much-needed African perspective on the development industry and why it has failed so miserably in lifting millions of people out of poverty.",,missionaries mercenaries and misfits | rasna warah,10685855.0,missionaries mercenaries and misfits,rasna warah,,,"Missionaries, Mercenaries and Misfits

The city has a long history that dates back to the 10th century when Arab and Persian traders began settling there. For centuries, Mogadishu was a traditional centre for Islam and an important hub for trade with communities along the Indian Ocean coastline. However, since the beginning of the civil war in the early 1990s, Somalia's capital city has gained the reputation of being the most dangerous and violent city in the world. Mogadishu Then and Now is an attempt to redeem the city's damaged reputation and restore its lost glory in the public imagination and in the Somali people's collective memory. The book showcases Mogadishu in all its splendour prior to the civil war and contrasts this with the devastation and destruction that has characterised the city for more than two decades.

At the same time the book is a courageous reflection in the dilemmas of African nationhood. Professor B. A. Ogot says: ""The main purpose of the book is to show that decolonization does not only mean the transfer of alien power to sovereign nationhood; it must also entail the liberation of the worlds of spirit and culture, as well as economics and politics. ""The book also raises a more fundamental question, that is: How much independence is available to any state, national economy or culture in today's world? It asks how far are Africa's miseries linked to the colonial past and to the process of decolonization? ""In particular the book raises the basic question of how far Kenya is avoidably neo-colonial? And what does neo-colonial dependence mean? The book answers these questions by discussing the dynamic between the politics of decolonization, the social history of class formation and the economics of dependence. The book ends with a provocative epilogue discussing the transformation of the post-colonial state from a single-party to a multi-party system.""",,decolonization and independence in kenya 1940 93 | bethwell a ogot,,decolonization and independence in kenya 1940 93,bethwell a ogot,,,"Decolonization and Independence in Kenya, 1940-93
